Be clear and specific\n   - Clearly state your task or question at the beginning of your message.\n   - Provide context and details to help Claude understand your needs.\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me with a presentation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need help creating a 10-slide presentation for our quarterly sales meeting. The presentation should cover our Q2 sales performance, top-selling products, and sales targets for Q3. Please provide an outline with key points for each slide.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific details about the task, including the number of slides, the purpose of the presentation, and the key topics to be covered.\n\n### 2. Use examples\n   - Provide examples of the kind of output you're looking for.\n   - If you want a specific format or style, show Claude an example.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write a professional email.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a professional email to a client about a project delay. Here's a similar email I've sent before:\n\n   'Dear [Client],\n   I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the progress of [Project Name]. Unfortunately, we've encountered an unexpected issue that will delay our completion date by approximately two weeks. We're working diligently to resolve this and will keep you updated on our progress.\n   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n   Best regards,\n   [Your Name]'\n\n   Help me draft a new email following a similar tone and structure, but for our current situation where we're delayed by a month due to supply chain issues.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides a concrete example of the desired style and tone, giving Claude a clear reference point for the new email.\n\n### 3. Encourage thinking\n   - For complex tasks, ask Claude to \"think step-by-step\" or \"explain your reasoning.\"\n   - This can lead to more accurate and detailed responses.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"How can I improve team productivity?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm looking to improve my team's productivity. Think through this step-by-step, considering the following factors:\n   1. Current productivity blockers (e.g., too many meetings, unclear priorities)\n   2. Potential solutions (e.g., time management techniques, project management tools)\n   3. Implementation challenges\n   4. Methods to measure improvement\n\n   For each step, please provide a brief explanation of your reasoning. Then summarize your ideas at the end.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt asks Claude to think through the problem systematically, providing a guided structure for the response and asking for explanations of the reasoning process. It also prompts Claude to create a summary at the end for easier reading.\n\n### 4. Iterative refinement\n   - If Claude's first response isn't quite right, ask for clarifications or modifications.\n   - You can always say \"That's close, but can you adjust X to be more like Y?\"\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Make it better.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"That\u2019s a good start, but please refine it further. Make the following adjustments:\n   1. Make the tone more casual and friendly\n   2. Add a specific example of how our product has helped a customer\n   3. Shorten the second paragraph to focus more on the benefits rather than the features\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific feedback and clear instructions for improvements, allowing Claude to make targeted adjustments instead of just relying on Claude\u2019s innate sense of what \u201cbetter\u201d might be \u2014 which is likely different from the user\u2019s definition!\n\n### 5. Leverage Claude's knowledge\n   - Claude has broad knowledge across many fields. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations or background information\n   - Be sure to include relevant context and details so that Claude\u2019s response is maximally targeted to be helpful\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"What is marketing? How do I do it?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm developing a marketing strategy for a new eco-friendly cleaning product line.

Use role-playing\n   - Ask Claude to adopt a specific role or perspective when responding.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me prepare for a negotiation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"You are a fabric supplier for my backpack manufacturing company. I'm preparing for a negotiation with this supplier to reduce prices by 10%. As the supplier, please provide:\n   1. Three potential objections to our request for a price reduction\n   2. For each objection, suggest a counterargument from my perspective\n   3. Two alternative proposals the supplier might offer instead of a straight price cut\n\n   Then, switch roles and provide advice on how I, as the buyer, can best approach this negotiation to achieve our goal.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt uses role-playing to explore multiple perspectives of the negotiation, providing a more comprehensive preparation. Role-playing also encourages Claude to more readily adopt the nuances of specific perspectives, increasing the intelligence and performance of Claude\u2019s response.\n\n\n## Task-specific tips and examples\n\n### Content Creation\n\n1. **Specify your audience**\n   - Tell Claude who the content is for.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write something about cybersecurity.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a blog post about cybersecurity best practices for small business owners.

Also, recommend one type of data visualization (e.g., graph, chart) that would be effective for each section.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides a clear structure and asks for specific elements (key points and data visualizations) for each section.\n\n### Document summary and Q&A\n\n1. **Be specific about what you want**\n   - Ask for a summary of specific aspects or sections of the document.\n   - Frame your questions clearly and directly.\n   - Be sure to specify what kind of summary (output structure, content type) you want\n\n2. **Use the document names**\n   - Refer to attached documents by name.\n\n3. **Ask for citations**\n   - Request that Claude cites specific parts of the document in its answers.\n\nHere is an example that combines all three of the above techniques:\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Summarize this report for me.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a 50-page market research report called 'Tech Industry Trends 2023'.

How is machine learning impacting job roles in the tech industry?\n   3.

It also indicates the ideal summary output structure, such as limiting the response to 2 paragraphs.\n\n### Data analysis and visualization\n\n1. **Specify the desired format**\n   - Clearly describe the format you want the data in.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Analyze our sales data.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a spreadsheet called 'Sales Data 2023'.

Integration capabilities\n   6. Best suited for (e.g., small teams, enterprise, specific industries)\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt requests a specific structure (table) for the comparison, provides clear criteria, making the information easy to understand and apply.\n  \n## Troubleshooting, minimizing hallucinations, and maximizing performance\n\n1. **Allow Claude to acknowledge uncertainty**\n   - Tell Claude that it should say it doesn\u2019t know if it doesn\u2019t know. Ex. \u201cIf you're unsure about something, it's okay to admit it. Just say you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n2. **Break down complex tasks**\n   - If a task seems too large and Claude is missing steps or not performing certain steps well, break it into smaller steps and work through them with Claude one message at a time.\n\n3. **Include all contextual information for new requests**\n   - Claude doesn't retain information from previous conversations, so include all necessary context in each new conversation.\n\n## Example good vs. bad prompt examples\n\nThese are more examples that combine multiple prompting techniques to showcase the stark difference between ineffective and highly effective prompts.\n\n### Example 1: Marketing strategy development\n\nBad prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"Help me create a marketing strategy.\"\n</prompt>\n\nGood prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"As a senior marketing consultant, I need your help developing a comprehensive marketing strategy for our new eco-friendly smartphone accessory line.

How is machine learning impacting job roles in the tech industry?\n   3. What potential risks or challenges does the report mention regarding AI adoption?\n\n   Please cite specific sections or page numbers when answering these questions.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt specifies the exact focus of the summary, provides specific questions, and asks for citations, ensuring a more targeted and useful response. It also indicates the ideal summary output structure, such as limiting the response to 2 paragraphs.\n\n### Data analysis and visualization\n\n1. **Specify the desired format**\n   - Clearly describe the format you want the data in.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Analyze our sales data.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a spreadsheet called 'Sales Data 2023'. Can you analyze this data and present the key findings in the following format:\n\n   1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\n\n   2. Key Metrics:\n      - Total sales for each quarter\n      - Top-performing product category\n      - Highest growth region\n\n   3. Trends:\n      - List 3 notable trends, each with a brief explanation\n\n   4. Recommendations:\n      - Provide 3 data-driven recommendations, each with a brief rationale\n\n   After the analysis, suggest three types of data visualizations that would effectively communicate these findings.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides a clear structure for the analysis, specifies key metrics to focus on, and asks for recommendations and visualization suggestions for further formatting.\n\n### Brainstorming\n 1. Use Claude to generate ideas by asking for a list of possibilities or alternatives.\n     - Be specific about what topics you want Claude to cover in its brainstorming\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Give me some team-building ideas.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"We need to come up with team-building activities for our remote team of 20 people. Can you help me brainstorm by:\n   1. Suggesting 10 virtual team-building activities that promote collaboration\n   2. For each activity, briefly explain how it fosters teamwork\n   3. Indicate which activities are best for:\n      a) Ice-breakers\n      b) Improving communication\n      c) Problem-solving skills\n   4. Suggest one low-cost option and one premium option.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides specific parameters for the brainstorming session, including the number of ideas, type of activities, and additional categorization, resulting in a more structured and useful output.\n\n2. Request responses in specific formats like bullet points, numbered lists, or tables for easier reading.\n\n   Bad Prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Compare project management software options.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good Prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"We're considering three different project management software options: Asana, Trello, and Microsoft Project. Can you compare these in a table format using the following criteria:\n   1. Key Features\n   2. Ease of Use\n   3. Scalability\n   4. Pricing (include specific plans if possible)\n   5. Integration capabilities\n   6. Best suited for (e.g., small teams, enterprise, specific industries)\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt requests a specific structure (table) for the comparison, provides clear criteria, making the information easy to understand and apply.\n  \n## Troubleshooting, minimizing hallucinations, and maximizing performance\n\n1. **Allow Claude to acknowledge uncertainty**\n   - Tell Claude that it should say it doesn\u2019t know if it doesn\u2019t know. Ex. \u201cIf you're unsure about something, it's okay to admit it. Just say you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n2. **Break down complex tasks**\n   - If a task seems too large and Claude is missing steps or not performing certain steps well, break it into smaller steps and work through them with Claude one message at a time.\n\n3. **Include all contextual information for new requests**\n   - Claude doesn't retain information from previous conversations, so include all necessary context in each new conversation.\n\n## Example good vs. bad prompt examples\n\nThese are more examples that combine multiple prompting techniques to showcase the stark difference between ineffective and highly effective prompts.\n\n### Example 1: Marketing strategy development\n\nBad prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"Help me create a marketing strategy.\"\n</prompt>\n\nGood prompt:\n<prompt>\n\"As a senior marketing consultant, I need your help developing a comprehensive marketing strategy for our new eco-friendly smartphone accessory line.

                "content": "Programming Assignment 5: Synchronization: Semaphores and producer consumer Queues\nCSE 220: Systems Programming\nIntroduction\nThis assignment will require you to implement a semaphore using mutexes and condition variables, then use your semaphore to implement a producer/consumer queue (FIFO) data structure for passing data between threads. You will use POSIX mutexes, condition variables, and threads in this project.\n1_Getting Started\nThe given code for this project contains two source files that you will have to modify, src/csesem.c and src/pcq.c, as well as two header files, src/csesem.h and src/pcq.h that you should not modify. It also contains the source for five tests (two for the semaphore and three for the producer consumer queue) that will run when you invoke make test. When you finish reading this handout, you should read both header files, the given tests, and the given sources before you begin implementation. You will find a variety of advice and clarifying comments in the given code.\n\n2_Semaphores\nThe first part of this project requires you to implement a semaphore called CSE_Semaphore using the API defined in src/csesem.h. There are extensive comments in this file explaining the API and its usage. Your semaphore will be tested directly, and it will also be used as a tool for implementing the second part of this project.\nYou will find information on semaphores in the lecture slides, and Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) contains a detailed description of semaphores with some examples of how to use them correctly in Chapter 31. You should read Chapters 30 and 31 of OSTEP carefully before starting this project, and refer to it as necessary during your implementation. In particular, you will find the producer consumer problem that is described in detail in Chapter 30 with example code in Figures 30.7 through 30.14 very useful. You may be able to use this code in your implementation with some modifications.\nAn efficient semaphore can be created using a mutex and a condition variable. You should implement the semaphore for this project in precisely that fashion.\nYou MUST NOT use POSIX semaphores in your implementation of CSE_Semaphore. \n2.1_POSIX_Mutexes\nThe Pthread mutex API has some complicated options, but you will not need them for this project. In particular, you do not need to use mutex attributes, and can pass NULL for any pointer to pthread_mutex_attr_t. You should only need the functions pthread_mutex_init() [3], pthread_mutex_lock() [3], pthread_mutex_unlock() [3], and pthread_mutex_destroy() [3].\nNote that POSIX mutexes are declared as type pthread_mutex_t, and then a pointer to the declared variable is passed to the functions that manipulate the mutex. See tests/counting_semaphore.c for an example of a typical mutex initialization and interaction.\n2.2_POSIX_Condition Variables\nThe condition variables provided with Pthreads are likewise more complicated than you will need. You may use NULL for condition variable attributes, as well, and you will not need the timed wait facility. You will use pthread_cond_init() [3], pthread_cond_wait() [3], pthread_cond_signal() [3], and possibly pthread_cond_broadcast() [3].\nLike mutexes, POSIX condition variables are declared as their type (pthread_cond_t) and manipulated as the address of the declared variable. The provided test tests/counting_semaphores.c and tests/synchronous_work.c contains examples of typical interactions with condition variables. In your semaphore implementation, you will need to utilize a condition variable to allow threadswhich are blocking on the semaphore towait without busywaiting, but be awoken when they can safely enter the semaphore.\nA typical use of a condition variable looks like these examples from tests/counting_semaphore.c; the first waits on a condition variable, and the second signals it:\n\n/* Waiting */\npthread_mutex_lock (&lock); \nwhile (!quit) {\npthread_cond_wait (&done , &lock); }\npthread_mutex_unlock (&lock);\n/* Signaling */ \npthread_mutex_lock (&lock); \nquit = 1; \npthread_mutex_unlock (&lock); \npthread_cond_broadcast (&done);\n\nObviously, these two operations would have to be executed in different threads for this code to make sense!\n\n3_producer_consumer_Queues\nThe second part of this project requires you to use the semaphore that you created (and likely other synchronization tools) to implement a producer consumer queue implementing the API found in src/pcq.h. This is a logical construction providing two basic operations:\n\u2022 A producer can add an item to the queue. If there is room on the queue, this itemwill immediately be added, where it will wait to be retrieved by a consumer. If there is no room on the queue, the producer will block until room is available, and then insert its item normally. Each item is added to the tail of the queue.\n\u2022 A consumer can remove an item from the queue. If at least one item is available on the queue, the consumer will immediately remove one item from the head of the queue and return it. If no items are available on the queue, the consumer will block until a producer places an item on the queue.\nNote that, because every producer places items on the tail of the queue and every consumer retrieves from the head, this provides first in first out (FIFO) semantics for items placed on the queue. The first item produced will be the first item consumed, and so on and so forth.\nYour implementation does not need to guarantee any particular ordering between different producers or consumers, but it does need to guarantee that all items placed on the queue by the same producer are placed in the order that theywere inserted, and that all items on the queue are removed in the order they were inserted. This means that you do not have to do anything special when waking threads that are blocked on the semaphore, you can simply allow the Pthreads implementation to wake whichever thread it wakes.\nThe item stored in each slot of your producer consumer queue is a single pointer of type void *. You may use this to store a pointer to any data structure, or to store an integer by casting the integer to and from void * when using the queue.\nThere is an example of producer consumer queues in OSTEP Chapter 30. You will not be able to use the example code from the text directly because it uses global variables (rather than created structures) and because it stores integers.\n3.1_Pointer_typedefs_and_Encapsulation\nThe data structure types in this project use typedef. In particular, the following typedefs appear in the given headers:\ntypedef struct CSE_Semaphore *CSE_Semaphore; typedef struct PCQueue *PCQueue;\nThis allows code that uses these types to be less verbose and more clear in its actual purpose. You may use these typedefs anywhere in your implementation and tests.\nAnother benefit of this construction is that the public interfaces for your semaphore and producer consumer queues speak in terms only of pointers to structures which are not defined in the public interface. This provides encapsulation of your implementation; no code external to csesem.c can manipulate the inner data structures of your semaphore, and no code external to pcq.c can manipulate the inner data structure of your producer consumer queue. This technique is often used in C. You can find more information about this technique and how it is used in this project in the respective headers.\n3.2 Partial Implementation\nIf your CSE_Semaphore implementation is sufficiently incomplete that it prevents your PCQueue from being completed, youmaychoose tousePOSIXsemaphores to implementyourPCQueue, in return foragradingpenalty. You may not use POSIX semaphores to implement CSE_Semaphore! The grading penalty is described below, in Section 7.\t\n4_Coordinated_Destruction_of_Resources\nThe destruction of resources in a multithreaded environment, and particularly the destruction of synchronization mechanisms, is fraught with peril. It is very easy to find yourself with an implementation that inadvertently accesses released resources or freed memory during the process of destroying synchronization tools.\nThink carefully about what resources are accessed when and by which threads, and arrange your code to ensure that all threads that might access a resource are notified that it is going to be destroyed and have been given an opportunity to release it before it is actually destroyed. You may find flags or counters in conjunction with condition variables useful for coordinating destruction of your producer consumer queue, in particular.\n5_Memory_Management\nEach of the two constructions in this project defines a create and destroy function. Your implementation should allocate anymemory that it needs on create, and free it on destroy for a given type. You should not use any global or static global variables in this project. All of the state for any semaphore or queue should be stored in the memory that is allocated on create.\nYou should use the standard dynamic allocator (e.g., malloc() or calloc() and free()) to manage this memory.\n6_Requirements\nYou must complete the APIs for both CSE_Semaphore and PCQueue as provided in the header files in the given code. In particular, you must implement:\n\u2022 CSE_Semaphore csesem_create(int count)\n\u2022 void csesem_wait(CSE_Semaphore sem)\n\u2022 void csesem_post(CSE_Semaphore sem)\n\u2022 void csesem_destroy(CSE_Semaphore sem)\n\u2022 PCQueue pcq_create(int slots)\n\u2022 void pcq_insert(PCQueue pcq, void *data)\n\u2022 void *pcq_retrieve(PCQueue pcq)\n\u2022 void pcq_destroy(PCQueue pcq)\nThe complete specifications for these functions are in their respective header files. As this API does not provide a way to report errors, you are not required to handle resource allocation\nerrors (e.g., failures of memory allocation or Pthreads creation functions) or application errors in accessing your implementation. You may assume that the application uses the API correctly as specified in the header files. In particular, the _create() functions will always run to completion before any other function is called on a CSE_Semaphore or PCQueue object, and no new accesses to the objects will be performed after the _destroy() functions have been invoked. (Note that there may be threads already accessing or blocked on your semaphore or queue when it is destroyed, and that it must handle that correctly!)\n7 Grading\nThis project is worth 5% of your final course grade. The points will be assigned as follows, although the Autograder score will not reflect the handout quiz:\n4\nPoints Description 2 Handout Quiz 7 CSE_Semaphore provides counting semaphore semantics 1.5 CSE_Semaphore destroys cleanly 8 PCQueue provides producer consumer queue semantics 1.5 PCQueue destroys cleanly",

                "content": " # Claude prompting guide\n\n## General tips for effective prompting\n\n### 1. Be clear and specific\n   - Clearly state your task or question at the beginning of your message.\n   - Provide context and details to help Claude understand your needs.\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me with a presentation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need help creating a 10-slide presentation for our quarterly sales meeting. The presentation should cover our Q2 sales performance, top-selling products, and sales targets for Q3. Please provide an outline with key points for each slide.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific details about the task, including the number of slides, the purpose of the presentation, and the key topics to be covered.\n\n### 2. Use examples\n   - Provide examples of the kind of output you're looking for.\n   - If you want a specific format or style, show Claude an example.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write a professional email.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a professional email to a client about a project delay. Here's a similar email I've sent before:\n\n   'Dear [Client],\n   I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the progress of [Project Name]. Unfortunately, we've encountered an unexpected issue that will delay our completion date by approximately two weeks. We're working diligently to resolve this and will keep you updated on our progress.\n   Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n   Best regards,\n   [Your Name]'\n\n   Help me draft a new email following a similar tone and structure, but for our current situation where we're delayed by a month due to supply chain issues.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides a concrete example of the desired style and tone, giving Claude a clear reference point for the new email.\n\n### 3. Encourage thinking\n   - For complex tasks, ask Claude to \"think step-by-step\" or \"explain your reasoning.\"\n   - This can lead to more accurate and detailed responses.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"How can I improve team productivity?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm looking to improve my team's productivity. Think through this step-by-step, considering the following factors:\n   1. Current productivity blockers (e.g., too many meetings, unclear priorities)\n   2. Potential solutions (e.g., time management techniques, project management tools)\n   3. Implementation challenges\n   4. Methods to measure improvement\n\n   For each step, please provide a brief explanation of your reasoning. Then summarize your ideas at the end.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt asks Claude to think through the problem systematically, providing a guided structure for the response and asking for explanations of the reasoning process. It also prompts Claude to create a summary at the end for easier reading.\n\n### 4. Iterative refinement\n   - If Claude's first response isn't quite right, ask for clarifications or modifications.\n   - You can always say \"That's close, but can you adjust X to be more like Y?\"\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Make it better.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"That\u2019s a good start, but please refine it further. Make the following adjustments:\n   1. Make the tone more casual and friendly\n   2. Add a specific example of how our product has helped a customer\n   3. Shorten the second paragraph to focus more on the benefits rather than the features\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt provides specific feedback and clear instructions for improvements, allowing Claude to make targeted adjustments instead of just relying on Claude\u2019s innate sense of what \u201cbetter\u201d might be \u2014 which is likely different from the user\u2019s definition!\n\n### 5. Leverage Claude's knowledge\n   - Claude has broad knowledge across many fields. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations or background information\n   - Be sure to include relevant context and details so that Claude\u2019s response is maximally targeted to be helpful\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"What is marketing? How do I do it?\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I'm developing a marketing strategy for a new eco-friendly cleaning product line. Can you provide an overview of current trends in green marketing? Please include:\n   1. Key messaging strategies that resonate with environmentally conscious consumers\n   2. Effective channels for reaching this audience\n   3. Examples of successful green marketing campaigns from the past year\n   4. Potential pitfalls to avoid (e.g., greenwashing accusations)\n\n   This information will help me shape our marketing approach.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt asks for specific, contextually relevant  information that leverages Claude's broad knowledge base. It provides context for how the information will be used, which helps Claude frame its answer in the most relevant way.\n\n### 6. Use role-playing\n   - Ask Claude to adopt a specific role or perspective when responding.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Help me prepare for a negotiation.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"You are a fabric supplier for my backpack manufacturing company. I'm preparing for a negotiation with this supplier to reduce prices by 10%. As the supplier, please provide:\n   1. Three potential objections to our request for a price reduction\n   2. For each objection, suggest a counterargument from my perspective\n   3. Two alternative proposals the supplier might offer instead of a straight price cut\n\n   Then, switch roles and provide advice on how I, as the buyer, can best approach this negotiation to achieve our goal.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt uses role-playing to explore multiple perspectives of the negotiation, providing a more comprehensive preparation. Role-playing also encourages Claude to more readily adopt the nuances of specific perspectives, increasing the intelligence and performance of Claude\u2019s response.\n\n\n## Task-specific tips and examples\n\n### Content Creation\n\n1. **Specify your audience**\n   - Tell Claude who the content is for.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write something about cybersecurity.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to write a blog post about cybersecurity best practices for small business owners. The audience is not very tech-savvy, so the content should be:\n   1. Easy to understand, avoiding technical jargon where possible\n   2. Practical, with actionable tips they can implement quickly\n   3. Engaging and slightly humorous to keep their interest\n\n   Please provide an outline for a 1000-word blog post that covers the top 5 cybersecurity practices these business owners should adopt.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: The good prompt specifies the audience, desired tone, and key characteristics of the content, giving Claude clear guidelines for creating appropriate and effective output.\n\n2. **Define the tone and style**\n   - Describe the desired tone.\n   - If you have a style guide, mention key points from it.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Write a product description.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Please help me write a product description for our new ergonomic office chair. Use a professional but engaging tone. Our brand voice is friendly, innovative, and health-conscious. The description should:\n   1. Highlight the chair's key ergonomic features\n   2. Explain how these features benefit the user's health and productivity\n   3. Include a brief mention of the sustainable materials used\n   4. End with a call-to-action encouraging readers to try the chair\n\n   Aim for about 200 words.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides clear guidance on the tone, style, and specific elements to include in the product description.\n\n3. **Define output structure**\n   - Provide a basic outline or list of points you want covered.\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Create a presentation on our company results.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I need to create a presentation on our Q2 results. Structure this with the following sections:\n   1. Overview\n   2. Sales Performance\n   3. Customer Acquisition\n   4. Challenges\n   5. Q3 Outlook\n\n   For each section, suggest 3-4 key points to cover, based on typical business presentations. Also, recommend one type of data visualization (e.g., graph, chart) that would be effective for each section.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Why it's better: This prompt provides a clear structure and asks for specific elements (key points and data visualizations) for each section.\n\n### Document summary and Q&A\n\n1. **Be specific about what you want**\n   - Ask for a summary of specific aspects or sections of the document.\n   - Frame your questions clearly and directly.\n   - Be sure to specify what kind of summary (output structure, content type) you want\n\n2. **Use the document names**\n   - Refer to attached documents by name.\n\n3. **Ask for citations**\n   - Request that Claude cites specific parts of the document in its answers.\n\nHere is an example that combines all three of the above techniques:\n\n   Bad prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"Summarize this report for me.\"\n   </prompt>\n\n   Good prompt:\n   <prompt>\n   \"I've attached a 50-page market research report called 'Tech Industry Trends 2023'. Can you provide a 2-paragraph summary focusing on AI and machine learning trends? Then, please answer these questions:\n   1. What are the top 3 AI applications in business for this year?\n   2. How is machine learning impacting job roles in the tech industry?\n   3.

                "content": "Picture this: A German director arrives in Hollywood, his mind still filled with images of Berlin's smoky cabarets and the haunting shadows of expressionist cinema. Yet here he stands, blinking in the harsh California sun, surrounded by palm trees and art deco buildings. This is the essence of what the chapter calls \"cultural schizophrenia\" - a mental tug-of-war between two worlds that couldn't be more different.\nTake Ernst Lubitsch, for example. Here's a man who made his name directing sophisticated European comedies, suddenly tasked with creating entertainment for American audiences who might never have set foot outside their home state. Can you imagine the cultural whiplash? It's like being asked to paint the Mona Lisa, but make her smile wider and add some jazz hands for good measure.\nThis clash of cultures wasn't just a creative challenge - it was an identity crisis playing out on celluloid. These filmmakers were caught in a bizarre balancing act, trying to stay true to their artistic roots while also trying to fit into the Hollywood machine. It's almost like they were method acting their own lives, playing the role of \"American director\" while their inner selves remained stubbornly European.\nBut here's where it gets really interesting: this cultural schizophrenia didn't just create confusion - it sparked creativity. These directors, caught between two worlds, ended up creating a unique cinematic language. They blended the shadows of German expressionism with the glossy sheen of Hollywood, resulting in films that were neither purely European nor entirely American, but something excitingly new.\nThink about film noir, that quintessentially American genre. Who do we have to thank for its moody atmospherics and complex antiheroes? Largely, it's these European transplants, bringing their Old World cynicism to the New World's optimism. It's as if their split cultural identity allowed them to see America through a unique lens - part admiring, part critical, wholly fascinating.\nI can't help but wonder: without this cultural schizophrenia, would Hollywood have evolved the way it did? Would we have gotten the razor-sharp satire of Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" or the psychological complexity of Fritz Lang's \"The Big Heat\"? It's like these directors were cultural alchemists, transforming their displacement and inner turmoil into cinematic gold.\nIn the end, this cultural schizophrenia wasn't just about being caught between two worlds - it was about creating a new world entirely. A world where the line between authenticity and performance blurred, where real experiences fueled fictional narratives, and where being an outsider became the ultimate insider perspective. It's a testament to the power of the immigrant experience in shaping not just individual lives, but entire art forms.",

                "content": "<german-filmmakers-and-hollywood>\n\nThe influx of European filmmakers, particularly from German-speaking countries, to Hollywood has been traditionally framed as a narrative of political refugees fleeing Fascism. However, this perspective oversimplifies a complex phenomenon that began before the rise of Nazism and involved economic and cultural factors as well as political ones.\n\n\n\nThe migration of German film talent to Hollywood was driven by multiple waves, starting in the 1920s. This movement was part of a broader pattern of cultural exchange and economic competition between the American and European film industries. The motivations for these migrations were diverse, including artistic ambition, economic opportunities, and later, political necessity.\n\n\n\nThe impact of these filmmakers on Hollywood was significant but not always straightforward. While some directors and actors achieved great success, others struggled to adapt to the American system. The exchange was not one-sided; Hollywood actively sought European talent to enhance its productions and expand its international appeal.\n\n</german-filmmakers-and-hollywood>\n\n<immigrants-or-invasions-exiles-or-trading-places-question>\n\nThis section challenges the idea of a German \"invasion\" of Hollywood. The author argues that American studios actively recruited European talent to exploit them internationally. He provides examples like Carl Laemmle's talent-scouting trips to Europe and the recruitment of directors like Michael Curtiz.\n\nThe relationship between European filmmakers and Hollywood was complex and multifaceted. While some came as refugees, others were adventurers or professionals seeking better opportunities. The chapter emphasizes that this migration was part of a broader pattern of international exchange in the film industry, driven by economic factors and the desire for global market dominance.\n\n\n\nThe experiences of individual filmmakers varied greatly. Some, like Ernst Lubitsch, achieved significant success and influence in Hollywood. Others, like William Dieterle, faced initial challenges but eventually found their niche. The chapter highlights how these filmmakers often had to navigate between their European identities and the expectations of American audiences and studios.\n\n</immigrants-or-invasions-exiles-or-trading-places-question>\n\n<wave-after-wave-question>\n\nThe migration of German filmmakers to Hollywood occurred in several distinct waves, each with its own characteristics and motivations. The first wave, exemplified by Ernst Lubitsch in 1921, was driven primarily by artistic and economic opportunities. The second wave, led by F.W. Murnau in 1925, brought directors known for their innovative and artistic films, as Hollywood sought to elevate its productions.\n\n\n\nA significant wave occurred around 1930, coinciding with the transition to sound in cinema. This group included filmmakers like William Dieterle, who were hired to create foreign-language versions of Hollywood films for international markets. This wave highlights the global nature of the film industry and the strategies employed by studios to maintain their dominance in foreign markets.\n\n\n\nThe final major wave, arriving after 1933, consisted more explicitly of political refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. This group included notable figures like Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, and Robert Siodmak. Many of these filmmakers had already established international careers, often with stops in Paris or London before reaching Hollywood. Their experiences reflect the complex interplay of political, economic, and cultural factors in shaping the migration patterns of European filmmakers.\n\n</wave-after-wave-question>\n\n<the-dynamics-of-uneven-exchanges>\n\nThe chapter explores the complex dynamics of cultural and economic exchanges between European filmmakers and Hollywood. It notes that while many German films of the \"classical\" era were not commercial successes in America, the impact of German talent on Hollywood was significant in less direct ways. The focus of competition was often not the American market itself, but rather American influence on European and other international audiences.\n\n\n\nThe contributions of German \u00e9migr\u00e9s extended beyond directors to include cinematographers, art directors, and composers. Figures like Karl Freund, Hans Dreier, and Max Steiner made lasting impacts in their respective fields. The chapter highlights how these behind-the-scenes professionals often had more enduring influence than some of the more visible directors or actors.\n\n\n\nThe experiences of \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Hollywood were often characterized by complex networks of ethnic bonding, professional rivalries, and cultural adjustments. Many found themselves recreating or reimagining European settings and stories for American audiences, leading to a peculiar dynamic where their \"Europeanness\" became both an asset and a constraint in their Hollywood careers.\n\n</the-dynamics-of-uneven-exchanges>\n\n<old-world-new-world>\n\nThe chapter examines the cultural tensions experienced by German \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Hollywood, highlighting the complex interplay between Old World and New World perspectives. Many filmmakers found themselves caught between their European backgrounds and the expectations of American audiences and studios. This led to a kind of cultural schizophrenia, where admiration for American modernity coexisted with a critical view of American society.\n\n\n\nHollywood often required European directors to recreate idealized versions of Europe, particularly Vienna and Paris, which became symbolic representations of the Old World for American audiences. This dynamic is exemplified by figures like Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, who crafted elaborate personas as European aristocrats, blending authenticity and artifice in their public images and film work.\n\n\n\nThe chapter argues that this cultural negotiation resulted in a unique perspective that allowed some \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers to offer insightful critiques of both European and American societies. Their work often engaged with themes of impersonation, pretense, and the tension between appearance and reality, reflecting their own experiences of cultural displacement and adaptation.\n\n</old-world-new-world>\n\n<cliches-in-the-air>\n\nThe chapter explores how the experiences of German filmmakers in Hollywood were shaped by mutual misconceptions and cultural stereotypes. It examines cases like Joe May and E.A. Dupont, whose American debuts were influenced by Hollywood's expectations of what constituted \"European\" cinema. These filmmakers often found themselves producing works that catered to American fantasies about Europe, particularly Vienna, rather than showcasing their own artistic visions.\n\n\n\nThe text highlights the phenomenon of cultural \"trade-offs,\" where \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers provided American audiences with idealized visions of Europe while simultaneously offering outsider perspectives on American society. This dynamic created a complex interplay of cultural identities and artistic expressions, often resulting in films that were neither authentically European nor typically American.\n\n\n\nThe careers of these filmmakers were frequently marked by discontinuities and shifts in artistic direction, as they navigated between their own artistic inclinations, the expectations of Hollywood studios, and the changing tastes of American audiences. The chapter suggests that understanding these careers requires considering them as comprising multiple, sometimes discrete \"slices\" rather than as linear progressions.\n\n</cliches-in-the-air>\n\n<sound-strategy-question>\n\nThe introduction of sound in cinema, often considered a barrier to the international dimension of filmmaking, is reassessed in this section. The chapter argues that sound did not necessarily hinder the movement of German directors between countries or diminish their influence on American cinema. Instead, it created new opportunities and challenges for \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers.\n\n\n\nThe text examines how some German \u00e9migr\u00e9 directors, such as Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, and Billy Wilder, significantly shaped American national mythology through their work in genres like film noir and melodrama. Their \"Germanic\" touch in psychological thrillers and suburban dramas is attributed more to the interplay of mutually sustaining \"national imaginaries\" than to a direct lineage from German Expressionism.\n\n\n\nThe section also discusses the case of E.A. Dupont and his involvement in early European sound films, particularly \"Atlantic\" (1929). This example illustrates how some \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers found themselves at the forefront of technological innovations in cinema, often due to the economic strategies of European production companies seeking to compete in international markets.\n\n</sound-strategy-question>\n\n<cultural-contraband>\n\nThe final section of the chapter explores the complex role of German \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers in Hollywood during the rise of anti-Nazi sentiment. It highlights the irony of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany often being cast as SS officers or high-ranking Nazis in American films, due to their accents. This situation underscores the complex interplay of identity, representation, and politics in Hollywood's portrayal of World War II.\n\n\n\nThe chapter discusses how some \u00e9migr\u00e9 directors, like Ernst Lubitsch in \"To Be or Not to Be\" (1942), used sophisticated comedy and irony to engage with the political realities of their time. It suggests that genres like film noir, sophisticated comedy, and melodrama could be as politically engaged as explicit anti-Nazi films, offering nuanced critiques through stylization and double meanings.\n\n\n\nThe text concludes by proposing that the most significant contribution of German \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Hollywood may have been in helping to create a \"country of the mind\" - a supreme fiction of displacement and virtual realities. This perspective suggests that the \u00e9migr\u00e9 experience profoundly influenced Hollywood's ability to create worlds of make-believe that resonated globally, blending elements of European and American cultures in complex ways.\n\n</cultural-contraband>",

                "content": "The scene marks a major turning point in the film. Directly preceding this scene, the bar owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart) refuses to give or sell letters of transit to the war hero/revolutionary Victor Laszlo (Paul Heinreid). The letters of transit are the only hope of freedom for Victor, and his only chance at returning to his efforts at insurgency against the Nazis; Rick knows this, but is still too hurt and bitter that his lost love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has chosen Victor over him. Rick\u2019s refusal is essentially a Nazi victory, despite his careful attempts at framing his (in)actions as simple neutrality. The Germans, led by Major Strausser (Conrad Veidt), have established a de facto control over Casablanca, acting through the openly self-interested French Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains).\n\nAfter \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d everything changes. The uneasy stalemate between Victor Laszlo and Major Strausser can no longer continue in the face of such open defiance of German power. Strausser orders Renault to find a pretense to shut down Rick\u2019s \u2014 leading to arguably the film\u2019s best exchange of dialogue. Strausser uses Ilsa to increase the pressure on Victor. Everything kicks into gear, as now Rick, Ilsa, Victor, and Louis are all forced into unpleasant decisions that will push the film toward its climax.\n\nAnd it all begins with the anthems. As Rick and Victor are ending their disagreement, they hear the German soldiers in the bar below, joyfully and triumphantly singing \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d The rest of the bar is made up largely of refugees from the German war machine, so the anthem feels almost like taunting, a callous display of German power over people seeking to escape their conquering. Even the ever-compliant Louis looks on at the singing with an expression that could be construed as disapproval, before glancing toward Rick to see what he\u2019ll do. (Rick is a constant source of curiosity for Louis throughout the film.) This expression is the first and barest foreshadowing we receive of Louis\u2019s eventual turn.\n\nVictor spends only seconds taking in the scene in front of him before marching straight down to the bar\u2019s band. As he passes, we see Ilsa watch him go by with a look of only partially contained dread. She knows this man and exactly what he\u2019s about to do.\n\nVictor reaches the band and immediately demands that they play \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the French national anthem. Here we see, for the first and perhaps only time, what has made Victor such an important figure. There\u2019s such a fierceness to him, an intensity that comes bursting out as he repeats his demand \u2014 \u201cPlay it\u201d \u2014 less than second after first making it.\n\nThe band leader looks first to Rick for approval; the film had already established previously the absolute loyalty that Rick receives from his employees, in a scene where the bartender cuts off a patron on Rick\u2019s orders despite protests for one more drink. Nothing that follows can happen without Rick\u2019s assent. Bogart\u2019s nod is such a small gesture, but carries such enormous weight. This is the first moment of Rick choosing a side, of joining in resistance in some small way.\n\nThe band launches into \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d with Victor leading the singing, and within two seconds, the entire bar (except the Germans) has stood and joined him. Everyone was ready and waiting for this to happen, even if they didn\u2019t know it: the kindling was already there, and Victor was the spark to light it. Major Strausser makes one attempt to rouse his soldiers into louder voices, but it\u2019s no use. The Germans are but one small enclave, finding themselves within a community that\u2019s filled with less traditional power but greater numbers and far superior zeal. Within moments, \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d has drowned out \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d\n\nStrausser is forced to give up and sit down in anger. That moment is also an example of one of the fascinating things about this scene, and why I\u2019ve rewatched it by itself so many times. While the main focus in on just a small handful of characters, there are numerous people around the edges of shots whose actions and expressions add greatly to the emotions being played out. Take, for instance, the German officer to Strausser\u2019s right (screen left), and the frustration and disgust on his face as he finally gives up the song.\n\nNow, only \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is playing, as the voices rise to a swell. And we come to the heart of the entire scene: Yvonne. The story of Yvonne (Madeleine Lebeau) in Casablanca is perhaps the greatest example of economy in storytelling that I\u2019ve seen. She appears in only three scenes in the entire film, with this one the last of them. Her total screen time combined is probably no more than a minute. And yet, in those brief stretches, we see an entire character arc play out; and what\u2019s more, an arc that acts as a microcosm of the entire film.\n\nWe first see Yvonne early in the film, as she\u2019s upset and confronting Rick because he\u2019s rebuffed her after the two of them apparently shared a one-night stand. She tries to get drunker, but Rick takes that away from her too and has her sent home. The next time she appears, she\u2019s at the bar and romantically entwined with a German soldier. A Frenchman takes exception to that pairing and starts a fight; Yvonne sides with the German. These two scenes, as brief as they are, tell us so much about her. She\u2019s a broken woman, desperately seeking a man, possibly for love but more likely for a sense of protection and comfort in dangerous times. This desperation leads her all the way to the point of willingly collaborating and romantically pairing with a German.\n\nBut then, there\u2019s \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d A sudden and fervent outburst of patriotism that spreads like wildfire through the bar, overwhelming the Germans and awakening a passion in its singers. As the song begins to near its climax, we get a close-up of Yvonne, singing along with a very different kind of passion. We see tears streaking down her face and a pained expression as she sings. In just these few seconds, you can see a mountain of development and emotion. The same woman who was willing to compromise everything for her own security is realizing how far that compromise has made her fall; is realizing that she may never see the homeland she loves again; is realizing that she\u2019d rather die a true Frenchwoman than live a traitor. It\u2019s the same type of journey we see Rick travel more slowly throughout the movie, and shows perhaps the film\u2019s most important motif: the choice between personal desire or safety and the greater good. How many people must have faced similar choices in the war \u2014 to collaborate or die? Yvonne isn\u2019t just herself in this scene; she\u2019s representing scores of people as she faces hard truths and makes her emotional break.\n\nWe then move to Ilsa, and without a word, she conveys everything we need to know about her relationship with Victor. The movie wouldn\u2019t be nearly as enduring without Bergman\u2019s flawless portrayal of Ilsa. It\u2019s easy to imagine a version of the film with Ilsa coming across as just a reductive caricature; her role in the plot revolves mostly around her being torn between two men whom she both loves. But Bergman imbues her with such subtle strength that Ilsa always feels like she has agency. Even when she tells Rick near the end that he must make the choices for both of them, it feels like a lie; she believes Rick will choose to keep her and him together, so telling him to make the choice is itself the choice.\n\nBut while Casablanca gives us flashbacks to Ilsa and Rick\u2019s time together in Paris, the development of Ilsa and Victor is mostly expository. This scene is perhaps the best representation of how they fit together. Victor charged past Ilsa without a word, and we already saw the dread in her face as she knew what he was about to do. Now we get the first shot of her reaction to \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d after it\u2019s begun. You can see it on her face and in the deep breaths she takes: she knows. She knows what this means for Victor, for his cause, for her, for their relationship. His open defiance in the face of the German soldiers will end all good hope they had of ever leaving Casablanca alive and together. You can see her heart breaking as she recognizes their predicament before anyone else in the room has even considered it.\n\nBut then the camera cuts back to Victor, still singing triumphantly. There is such bravado in Henreid\u2019s performance here; it\u2019s the one scene where you can really see Victor as a revolutionary leader, capable of inspiring people into acts of defiance in the face of tyranny. When the camera reaches Ilsa again, her expression has softened, melted even, into one of love. A bittersweet love, perhaps, but an evident one. She knows that this reckless disregard for his own life is that same thing that once landed Victor in a concentration camp and threatens him again now in Casablanca, but that zeal must be the same reason she fell for him in the first place. Again, the economy of storytelling here is remarkable. Within a handful of seconds, an entire wordless story has been told: Ilsa\u2019s sad resignation to their changing circumstances, Victor\u2019s passionate defiance, and Ilsa\u2019s acceptance of her husband, loving him for the fact that his greatest flaws are also his greatest virtues.\n\nIlsa\u2019s acceptance is the final act needed for \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d to move on to reach its climax. Within less than just a couple of minutes, we have had the German aggression, Victor\u2019s rebellion against it, Rick taking his first stand, the overwhelming passion of the French crowd, the redemption of Yvonne painting a story representative of the whole film, and Ilsa and Victor\u2019s unconventional love in the face of adversity. All that remains is the final groundswell.\n\nThe power of this scene is helped, of course, by the indisputable fact that \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is an incredible national anthem. While I\u2019m by no means an expert, it\u2019s the best one I\u2019ve ever heard from any country, and its association in my mind with this scene is highly likely to always keep it there. But the scene is also helped by the people in it. The main actors are at their finest here, and I already mentioned how supporting actors gave great little tidbits in the German soldier part.\n\nYet perhaps the greatest thing in this scene is that most of the people in it weren\u2019t actors at all; rather, director Michael Curtiz filled the scene with actual French refugees. Keep in mind, this movie came out in 1942 and was filmed at the height of World War II, at a time when Germany looked nearly unbeatable and Nazi occupation of France was indefinite. And here was a group of refugees from that occupation, given the chance to sing their anthem with defiant pride. For one brief moment, this wasn\u2019t a movie. It was real life, and it was tragic, and it was brave. Reports have said that extras were crying on set during filming, and the passion is evident any time you look past the main actors to the background singers. Note, for instance, the furious arm pump by the man in the background behind the blonde woman at the left of the screen:\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the film is entirely in English; \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is the only foreign language sequence I can recall, and it\u2019s presented without subtitles. (You can find the English translation here; it\u2019s very much a true battle song, in the goriest sense of the phrase.)  For some reason, that adds even more to its power for me. It\u2019s unapologetically French, and derives much of its power from that. It was their anthem, at the time they needed it most. And for the film\u2019s audience, most of whom were probably not speaking French, the intentional creation of a brief language barrier allows for a pure distillation of the passion of the singing; it\u2019s not the words that matter, it\u2019s what they represent to the people saying them. And what they represent is an ability to stand up in their darkest hour and show their oppressors that their pride will never be extinguished.\n\nThe song ends with one final shot of Yvonne, the final time we see her in the film. With wet cheeks, she yells \u201cVive la France!\u201d\n\nI truly believe this remains the greatest scene ever filmed. It\u2019s filled with such raw power and emotion, showing a beacon of light in the midst of some of humanity\u2019s darkest days. It tells so much of a story in such a brief moment, distilling numerous characters down to their cores and giving them developments and arcs through the merest of glances. It\u2019s the turning point that pushes the plot and its characters to the point of no return, where a final and deadly confrontation will become necessary. All because of the power of a single song, and its ability to inspire, to create and destroy, to stoke passions and reconciliations and fears and loves. All because of \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d\n\nVive la France, indeed.",

                "content": "The \"La Marseillaise\" scene in Casablanca (1942) stands as a powerful cinematic moment, encapsulating the film's themes of resistance, patriotism, and the human spirit in the face of oppression. Set against the backdrop of World War II, this scene masterfully weaves together the personal and political, creating a stirring tableau of defiance against Nazi occupation.\nAs the scene unfolds, we find ourselves in Rick's Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, a melting pot of refugees, resistance fighters, and occupying forces. The catalyst for this pivotal moment is the arrival of Major Strasser and his Nazi cohort, their presence a palpable threat to the uneasy equilibrium of the caf\u00e9. As they begin to sing \"Die Wacht am Rhein,\" a German patriotic anthem, the atmosphere grows tense, the camera panning across faces etched with fear and resentment.\nIt is in this charged moment that Yvonne, a French refugee previously seen collaborating with the Germans, makes a decisive stand. Her impassioned cry to the band, \"Play La Marseillaise! Play it!\" serves as a rallying call, igniting a spark of resistance that spreads like wildfire through the caf\u00e9. Victor Laszlo, the embodiment of the resistance movement, seizes the moment. With a nod from Rick, tacitly granting permission, Laszlo leads the patrons in a rousing rendition of the French national anthem.\nThe cinematography in this scene is nothing short of masterful. Close-ups capture the raw emotion on the faces of the singers, their eyes glistening with tears of patriotic fervor. The camera moves fluidly between wide shots of the growing chorus and intimate frames of individual performers, creating a visual rhythm that mirrors the swelling of voices and emotions. The lighting, soft yet dramatic, casts a warm glow on the singers, symbolizing the flame of hope and resistance burning within them.\nThe performances are equally compelling. Victor Laszlo's commanding presence as he leads the anthem, his voice strong and unwavering, contrasts sharply with the visible discomfort of Captain Renault and his men. Yvonne's transformation from collaborator to patriot is palpable, her face a canvas of emotion as she sings with fervent passion. The extras, portraying the diverse group of refugees, deliver performances so genuine and heartfelt that one can almost forget they are actors.\nThe editing of the scene is a testament to the power of montage. Quick cuts between the competing groups - the defiant French patriots and the increasingly agitated Nazis - build tension and highlight the ideological battle playing out in song. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the anthem to build organically while maintaining the suspense of how this impromptu act of rebellion will conclude.\nSound plays a crucial role in the scene's impact. The gradual rise of \"La Marseillaise\" over \"Die Wacht am Rhein\" is not just a battle of volume but a symbolic triumph of freedom over oppression. The mixing of voices, from tentative beginnings to a full-throated chorus, creates a sonic journey that mirrors the characters' emotional arcs.\nThe mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is rich with symbolism. The caf\u00e9, with its eclectic mix of patrons and staff, becomes a microcosm of occupied Europe. The positioning of characters - Laszlo at the forefront, Rick observing from the periphery, Strasser and his men isolated and outnumbered - speaks volumes about the power dynamics at play.\nThis scene transcends its narrative function, becoming a powerful statement on cultural identity and resistance. \"La Marseillaise,\" more than just a national anthem, becomes a battle cry for freedom, a reminder of the France that was and the hope for what it could be again. The participation of the diverse group of refugees underscores the universal yearning for liberty and the power of music to unite disparate individuals under a common cause.\nIn the end, as the last notes of the anthem fade and Strasser's impotent rage boils over, we are left with a profound sense of the indomitable human spirit. This scene, in its brief but potent runtime, encapsulates the essence of Casablanca - a tale of love, sacrifice, and the eternal struggle against tyranny. It reminds us that even in the darkest of times, the light of hope and resistance can never truly be extinguished.",

                "content": "1. Introduction\nAn instant messaging application allows users to communicate via text messages in real time. Users interact with the instant messaging application through a client. When a user composes a message and sends it from their client application, that message is sent to a server which then distributes it to all of the recipient client applications. Communication between client and server is achieved by sending packets. The packets follow a specific format and carry a data payload in addition to other useful information about the message (such information is often called metadata). In this assignment, you will implement the packet encoding and decoding for a basic instant messaging protocol. You will be using void pointers and pointer arithmetic, along with functions from string.h, to accomplish this. You will learn about pointer arithmetic, raw memory access, and data serialization. This assignment only requires you to encode and decode the outgoing and incoming packets, the rest of the instant messaging application is already implemented for you. This assignment provides you with an instant messaging server and the remainder of the instant messaging application described in the previous paragraph. When the server is running, a client can connect and thereby communicate with other users also connected to that server. When the client process is started, the user\u2019s terminal window is split into two regions: a single line at the bottom where the user can type a command (the command region), and the remainder of the window at the top dedicated to the reponses received from the server (the response region).\n\n2. Requirements\nIn this assignment, you must implement encoding and decoding of data packets. The packet formats used in this assignment are specified in Section 3. You will implement four functions (note that each packet passed as a void *):\n\nint pack(void *packed, char *input):\nParse input, a well-formed C string, to determine the packet type and fill packed with the encoded input.\n\u2022 int pack_refresh(void *packed, int message_id):\nFill packed with an encoded refresh packet according to the specification in Section 3.5.\n\u2022 int unpack(char *message, void *packed):\nDecode packed based on the packet type and fill message with the decoded string.\n\u2022 int unpack_statistics(struct statistics *statistics, void *packed):\nDecode packed according to the STATISTICS format specified in Section 3.4, filling statistics with the data.\n\nYour program must parse user input and send the correct type of packet. User inputs that begin with special characters \u201c/\u201d or \u201c@\u201d may be handled specially (see Section 3). No input that begins with \u201c/\u201d that is not specified in this document will ever be tested, and you may use this to implement commands starting with slash for debugging (if it is useful to you). For each of the above functions, the return value must be the integer value of the packet type as defined in serialize.h, or -1 for invalid inputs. You should assume that any non-NULL pointer passed to a function is correctly allocated and indicates a region of memory of an adequate size. Other than that, you should not make any assumptions about the validity of inputs; you are responsible for validating them. This includes unreasonable or meaningless user input, as well as malformed data to be unpacked. Some examples of invalid values will be described in Section 3.\n\nSTATUS\nThis packet type sets your status on the server. It should be sent when the user input starts with \u201c/me\u201d\nfollowed by a space. Any input starting with \u201c/me\u201d followed by any other character is invalid.\n\u2022 LABELED\nThis packet type tags another user. It is sent when the user input starts with \u201c@\u201d followed by at least\none and no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by an ASCII space. NAME_SIZE is defined in\nsrc/serialize.h.\n\u2022 STATISTICS\nThis packet type is used to request and receive a set of basic statistics from the server. It is sent when\nthe user input starts with \u201c/stats\u201d followed by the end of the input. Any input beginning with \u201c/stats\u201d\nfollowed by any other character is invalid.\n\u2022 MESSAGE\nThis packet type is just a normal text message sent by a user. It should be sent if the user input does not\nfall into any of the above categories.\n\u2022 REFRESH\nThis packet is sent to the server by the client to request new messages to decode. This packet is different\nfrom the others in that it is sent once every second and has no relation to user input.\n\nNote that the formats in this assignment are very specific, and must be implemented precisely. This includes details such as white space and the value of padding bytes. Be sure not to include any extra characters in quoted strings, insert extra newlines or other formatting, or deviate from this specification in any way!\nThe STATUS, LABELED, and MESSAGE packets have the following general form:\n| int         | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]     | size_t | char[] |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| packet type | UBIT name       | data lengths | 0      | data   |\n\nThe first part of the packet is common among the different packet types. It starts with an integer value indicating the packet type. This would be one of the packet types described above (REFRESH, MESSAGE, etc.), as defined in serialize.h. Following this is a character array of exactly NAME_SIZE bytes, (NAME_SIZE is also defined in serialize.h). This character array is valid if and only if it contains the sender\u2019s UBIT Name followed by sufficient ASCII NUL bytes to fill out the NAME_SIZE bytes of the array.\n\nThe remainder of the packet describes the actual data of the message. The \u201cData Lengths\u201d field can be thought of as an array of type size_t, which varies in length based on the packet type. This list will always have a final value of 0, which terminates it. For each non-zero value in this list, there is an associated sequence of characters in the \u201cData\u201d field. To give a simple example, if the Data Lengths field held the array {2, 5, 0}, and the Data field held the string \u201chihello\u201d, that would signify that there are two strings in the data area of the packet (of sizes two and five respectively), and that their contents are \u201chi\u201d and \u201chello\u201d. Note that the data fields are not C strings, and do not include a terminating NUL byte! Note also that, due to ambiguity with the 0 terminating length value, no valid packet can contain a field of length 0. The sum of all data lengths in any packet must not exceed MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, as defined in src/serialize.h.\n\nThe formats of the STATISTICS and REFRESH packets do not adhere to the general form given above, but can be found in the in-depth descriptions of each of the specific packet formats below.\n\n3.1 message\n\nMESSAGE\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]   | size_t | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| MESSAGE | UBIT name       | msg length | 0      | msg    |\n\nThe message packet is the simplest data-carrying packet, holding only a single data field and its length. The data should be the entirety of the message input by the user including any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nNote that every character after the \u201cs\u201d in the UBIT Name field should be a NUL character, which you should remember has a integer representation of zero, and is idiomatically written as '\\0'. A message containing only ASCII space characters should not be encoded, and the pack function should instead return invalid. When decoding this packet, the resulting string should be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: Message\u201d; the above packet would decode to \u201cpagottes: My name is Peter\u201d. Note that there is both a colon and a space between the UBIT Name and the Message.\n\n3.2 status\n\nSTATUS\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]      | size_t | char[] |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | status length | 0      | status |\n\nThis packet type is very similar to that of the message type; however, the data it contains differs. As previously mentioned, the status packet type is sent when the user input begins with \u201c/me\u201d followed by one or more space characters. When you encode this input you should only send the status itself, not the \u201c/me\u201d or any of the spaces between it and the next non-space character. If the user input was \u201c/me says hi\u201d, the data encoded should be simply \u201csays hi\u201d; this would be the same for a dozen spaces of separation as a single space. Like the message packet type, a status of only spaces should be considered invalid. A status should be decoded nearly the same as a message, but it should not have a colon, so it would be \u201cUBIT Name Status\u201d. If the user pagottes were to send a status resulting from the user input \u201c/me says hi\u201d, it would be decoded by a client as \u201cpagottes says hi\u201d\n\n3.3 labeled\n\nLABELED\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t     | size_t        | size_t | char[]  | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LABELED | UBIT name       | msg length | target length | 0      | message | target |\n\nThe labeled packet is the most complex type to pack. You will recall that this packet type is sent when the\nuser input begins with an \u201c@\u201d, followed by one to no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by a\nspace. The characters between the \u201c@\u201d and the first space are the \u201cTarget\u201d. Note that this does not include\nthe initial character \u201c@\u201d. The characters starting with the first non-space character after the target is the\n\u201cMessage\u201d. The same rules on space characters from the previous subsection apply. Any input starting with\n\u201c@\u201d that does not match the input format for a labeled message is an invalid input.\nIf the user pagottes input the text \u201c@elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d, it would be encoded as:\n\n1. The integer LABELED\n2. The characters in \u201cpagottes\u201d padded out to NAME_SIZE bytes\n3. A size_t containing 39 (the number of characters in \u201cthe Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d)\n4. A size_t containing 3 (the number of characters in \u201celb\u201d)\n5. A size_t containing 0\n6. The 39 characters of the message\n7. The 3 characters of the target\n\nWhen decoding, the string is expected to be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: @Target Message\u201d. In the above\nexample, it would be \u201cpagottes: @elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d.\n\n3.4 statistics\n\nSTATISTICS\n| int        | char[NAME_SIZE] | char[NAME_SIZE] | int               | int           | int           | int           |\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| STATISTICS | UBIT name       | most active     | most active count | invalid count | refresh count | message count |\n\nYou should immediately notice that the statistics packet does not conform to the general format mentioned at the beginning of this section. Instead, it stores data corresponding to the members of the statistics struct defined in serialize.h:\nstruct statistics {\nchar sender [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* Name of sender */\nint messages_count ; /* Number of packets sent to the server */\nchar most_active [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* User who has sent the most messages */\nint most_active_count ; /* Number of messages sent by that user */\nlong invalid_count ; /* Number of invalid packets sent to the server */\nlong refresh_count ; /* Number of refresh packets sent to the server */\n};\nWhen encoding the statistics packet, none of this information is available to you, so you should only populate the packet type and your own UBIT Name. When decoding, you will decode this information into a statistics structure handed to the unpack_statistics function. The given client code will handle formatting the output printed to the screen.\n\n3.5 refresh\n\nREFRESH\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | int        |\n|--------|-----------------|------------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | message id |\n\nThe refresh packet is another packet which does not conform to the general case. It simply stores the packet type, your UBIT, and the ID of the last packet that your client received. This packet type is also special in the fact that you will only have to encode it, as it is never sent from the server to the client. Because this packet type is used in the process of communication with the server, pack_refresh() is the first thing you should implement. If this function does not work correctly, you will not receive any messages.\n\n4. Using the Client\n\nWhen you start the chat client, you will be presented with a full-screen terminal application having a box at the bottom for user input.

                "content": "<german-filmmakers-and-hollywood>\n\nThe influx of European filmmakers, particularly from German-speaking countries, to Hollywood has been traditionally framed as a narrative of political refugees fleeing Fascism. However, this perspective oversimplifies a complex phenomenon that began before the rise of Nazism and involved economic and cultural factors as well as political ones.\n\n\n\nThe migration of German film talent to Hollywood was driven by multiple waves, starting in the 1920s. This movement was part of a broader pattern of cultural exchange and economic competition between the American and European film industries. The motivations for these migrations were diverse, including artistic ambition, economic opportunities, and later, political necessity.\n\n\n\nThe impact of these filmmakers on Hollywood was significant but not always straightforward. While some directors and actors achieved great success, others struggled to adapt to the American system. The exchange was not one-sided; Hollywood actively sought European talent to enhance its productions and expand its international appeal.\n\n</german-filmmakers-and-hollywood>\n\n<immigrants-or-invasions-exiles-or-trading-places-question>\n\nThis section challenges the idea of a German \"invasion\" of Hollywood. The author argues that American studios actively recruited European talent to exploit them internationally. He provides examples like Carl Laemmle's talent-scouting trips to Europe and the recruitment of directors like Michael Curtiz.\n\nThe relationship between European filmmakers and Hollywood was complex and multifaceted. While some came as refugees, others were adventurers or professionals seeking better opportunities. The chapter emphasizes that this migration was part of a broader pattern of international exchange in the film industry, driven by economic factors and the desire for global market dominance.\n\n\n\nThe experiences of individual filmmakers varied greatly. Some, like Ernst Lubitsch, achieved significant success and influence in Hollywood. Others, like William Dieterle, faced initial challenges but eventually found their niche. The chapter highlights how these filmmakers often had to navigate between their European identities and the expectations of American audiences and studios.\n\n</immigrants-or-invasions-exiles-or-trading-places-question>\n\n<wave-after-wave-question>\n\nThe migration of German filmmakers to Hollywood occurred in several distinct waves, each with its own characteristics and motivations. The first wave, exemplified by Ernst Lubitsch in 1921, was driven primarily by artistic and economic opportunities. The second wave, led by F.W. Murnau in 1925, brought directors known for their innovative and artistic films, as Hollywood sought to elevate its productions.\n\n\n\nA significant wave occurred around 1930, coinciding with the transition to sound in cinema. This group included filmmakers like William Dieterle, who were hired to create foreign-language versions of Hollywood films for international markets. This wave highlights the global nature of the film industry and the strategies employed by studios to maintain their dominance in foreign markets.\n\n\n\nThe final major wave, arriving after 1933, consisted more explicitly of political refugees fleeing Nazi Germany. This group included notable figures like Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, and Robert Siodmak. Many of these filmmakers had already established international careers, often with stops in Paris or London before reaching Hollywood. Their experiences reflect the complex interplay of political, economic, and cultural factors in shaping the migration patterns of European filmmakers.\n\n</wave-after-wave-question>\n\n<the-dynamics-of-uneven-exchanges>\n\nThe chapter explores the complex dynamics of cultural and economic exchanges between European filmmakers and Hollywood. It notes that while many German films of the \"classical\" era were not commercial successes in America, the impact of German talent on Hollywood was significant in less direct ways. The focus of competition was often not the American market itself, but rather American influence on European and other international audiences.\n\n\n\nThe contributions of German \u00e9migr\u00e9s extended beyond directors to include cinematographers, art directors, and composers. Figures like Karl Freund, Hans Dreier, and Max Steiner made lasting impacts in their respective fields. The chapter highlights how these behind-the-scenes professionals often had more enduring influence than some of the more visible directors or actors.\n\n\n\nThe experiences of \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Hollywood were often characterized by complex networks of ethnic bonding, professional rivalries, and cultural adjustments. Many found themselves recreating or reimagining European settings and stories for American audiences, leading to a peculiar dynamic where their \"Europeanness\" became both an asset and a constraint in their Hollywood careers.\n\n</the-dynamics-of-uneven-exchanges>\n\n<old-world-new-world>\n\nThe chapter examines the cultural tensions experienced by German \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Hollywood, highlighting the complex interplay between Old World and New World perspectives. Many filmmakers found themselves caught between their European backgrounds and the expectations of American audiences and studios. This led to a kind of cultural schizophrenia, where admiration for American modernity coexisted with a critical view of American society.\n\n\n\nHollywood often required European directors to recreate idealized versions of Europe, particularly Vienna and Paris, which became symbolic representations of the Old World for American audiences. This dynamic is exemplified by figures like Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, who crafted elaborate personas as European aristocrats, blending authenticity and artifice in their public images and film work.\n\n\n\nThe chapter argues that this cultural negotiation resulted in a unique perspective that allowed some \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers to offer insightful critiques of both European and American societies. Their work often engaged with themes of impersonation, pretense, and the tension between appearance and reality, reflecting their own experiences of cultural displacement and adaptation.\n\n</old-world-new-world>\n\n<cliches-in-the-air>\n\nThe chapter explores how the experiences of German filmmakers in Hollywood were shaped by mutual misconceptions and cultural stereotypes. It examines cases like Joe May and E.A. Dupont, whose American debuts were influenced by Hollywood's expectations of what constituted \"European\" cinema. These filmmakers often found themselves producing works that catered to American fantasies about Europe, particularly Vienna, rather than showcasing their own artistic visions.\n\n\n\nThe text highlights the phenomenon of cultural \"trade-offs,\" where \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers provided American audiences with idealized visions of Europe while simultaneously offering outsider perspectives on American society. This dynamic created a complex interplay of cultural identities and artistic expressions, often resulting in films that were neither authentically European nor typically American.\n\n\n\nThe careers of these filmmakers were frequently marked by discontinuities and shifts in artistic direction, as they navigated between their own artistic inclinations, the expectations of Hollywood studios, and the changing tastes of American audiences. The chapter suggests that understanding these careers requires considering them as comprising multiple, sometimes discrete \"slices\" rather than as linear progressions.\n\n</cliches-in-the-air>\n\n<sound-strategy-question>\n\nThe introduction of sound in cinema, often considered a barrier to the international dimension of filmmaking, is reassessed in this section. The chapter argues that sound did not necessarily hinder the movement of German directors between countries or diminish their influence on American cinema. Instead, it created new opportunities and challenges for \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers.\n\n\n\nThe text examines how some German \u00e9migr\u00e9 directors, such as Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, and Billy Wilder, significantly shaped American national mythology through their work in genres like film noir and melodrama. Their \"Germanic\" touch in psychological thrillers and suburban dramas is attributed more to the interplay of mutually sustaining \"national imaginaries\" than to a direct lineage from German Expressionism.\n\n\n\nThe section also discusses the case of E.A. Dupont and his involvement in early European sound films, particularly \"Atlantic\" (1929). This example illustrates how some \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers found themselves at the forefront of technological innovations in cinema, often due to the economic strategies of European production companies seeking to compete in international markets.\n\n</sound-strategy-question>\n\n<cultural-contraband>\n\nThe final section of the chapter explores the complex role of German \u00e9migr\u00e9 filmmakers in Hollywood during the rise of anti-Nazi sentiment. It highlights the irony of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany often being cast as SS officers or high-ranking Nazis in American films, due to their accents. This situation underscores the complex interplay of identity, representation, and politics in Hollywood's portrayal of World War II.\n\n\n\nThe chapter discusses how some \u00e9migr\u00e9 directors, like Ernst Lubitsch in \"To Be or Not to Be\" (1942), used sophisticated comedy and irony to engage with the political realities of their time. It suggests that genres like film noir, sophisticated comedy, and melodrama could be as politically engaged as explicit anti-Nazi films, offering nuanced critiques through stylization and double meanings.\n\n\n\nThe text concludes by proposing that the most significant contribution of German \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Hollywood may have been in helping to create a \"country of the mind\" - a supreme fiction of displacement and virtual realities. This perspective suggests that the \u00e9migr\u00e9 experience profoundly influenced Hollywood's ability to create worlds of make-believe that resonated globally, blending elements of European and American cultures in complex ways.\n\n</cultural-contraband>",

                "content": "1. Introduction\nAn instant messaging application allows users to communicate via text messages in real time. Users interact with the instant messaging application through a client. When a user composes a message and sends it from their client application, that message is sent to a server which then distributes it to all of the recipient client applications. Communication between client and server is achieved by sending packets. The packets follow a specific format and carry a data payload in addition to other useful information about the message (such information is often called metadata). In this assignment, you will implement the packet encoding and decoding for a basic instant messaging protocol. You will be using void pointers and pointer arithmetic, along with functions from string.h, to accomplish this. You will learn about pointer arithmetic, raw memory access, and data serialization. This assignment only requires you to encode and decode the outgoing and incoming packets, the rest of the instant messaging application is already implemented for you. This assignment provides you with an instant messaging server and the remainder of the instant messaging application described in the previous paragraph. When the server is running, a client can connect and thereby communicate with other users also connected to that server. When the client process is started, the user\u2019s terminal window is split into two regions: a single line at the bottom where the user can type a command (the command region), and the remainder of the window at the top dedicated to the responses received from the server (the response region).\n\n2. Requirements\nIn this assignment, you must implement encoding and decoding of data packets. The packet formats used in this assignment are specified in Section 3. You will implement four functions (note that each packet passed as a void *):\n\n- int pack(void *packed, char *input):\nParse input, a well-formed C string, to determine the packet type and fill packed with the encoded input.\n- int pack_refresh(void *packed, int message_id):\nFill packed with an encoded refresh packet according to the specification in Section 3.5.\n- int unpack(char *message, void *packed):\nDecode packed based on the packet type and fill message with the decoded string.\n- int unpack_statistics(struct statistics *statistics, void *packed):\nDecode packed according to the STATISTICS format specified in Section 3.4, filling statistics with the data.\n\nYour program must parse user input and send the correct type of packet. User inputs that begin with special characters \u201c/\u201d or \u201c@\u201d may be handled specially (see Section 3). No input that begins with \u201c/\u201d that is not specified in this document will ever be tested, and you may use this to implement commands starting with slash for debugging (if it is useful to you). For each of the above functions, the return value must be the integer value of the packet type as defined in serialize.h, or -1 for invalid inputs. You should assume that any non-NULL pointer passed to a function is correctly allocated and indicates a region of memory of an adequate size. Other than that, you should not make any assumptions about the validity of inputs; you are responsible for validating them. This includes unreasonable or meaningless user input, as well as malformed data to be unpacked. Some examples of invalid values will be described in Section 3.\n\n3. Packet formats\nthe following is information of the format and structure of the packets, encapsulated in XML tags for clarity.\n<packet_formats>\nThe instant messenger application defines several packet types:\n- STATUS\nThis packet type sets your status on the server. It should be sent when the user input starts with \u201c/me\u201d\nfollowed by a space. Any input starting with \u201c/me\u201d followed by any other character is invalid.\n- LABELED\nThis packet type tags another user. It is sent when the user input starts with \u201c@\u201d followed by at least\none and no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by an ASCII space. NAME_SIZE is defined in\nsrc/serialize.h.\n- STATISTICS\nThis packet type is used to request and receive a set of basic statistics from the server. It is sent when\nthe user input starts with \u201c/stats\u201d followed by the end of the input. Any input beginning with \u201c/stats\u201d\nfollowed by any other character is invalid.\n- MESSAGE\nThis packet type is just a normal text message sent by a user. It should be sent if the user input does not\nfall into any of the above categories.\n- REFRESH\nThis packet is sent to the server by the client to request new messages to decode. This packet is different\nfrom the others in that it is sent once every second and has no relation to user input.\n\nNote that the formats in this assignment are very specific, and must be implemented precisely. This includes details such as white space and the value of padding bytes. Be sure not to include any extra characters in quoted strings, insert extra newlines or other formatting, or deviate from this specification in any way!\nThe STATUS, LABELED, and MESSAGE packets have the following general form:\n| int         | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]     | size_t | char[] |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| packet type | UBIT name       | data lengths | 0      | data   |\n\nThe first part of the packet is common among the different packet types. It starts with an integer value indicating the packet type. This would be one of the packet types described above (REFRESH, MESSAGE, etc.), as defined in serialize.h. Following this is a character array of exactly NAME_SIZE bytes, (NAME_SIZE is also defined in serialize.h). This character array is valid if and only if it contains the sender\u2019s UBIT Name followed by sufficient ASCII NUL bytes to fill out the NAME_SIZE bytes of the array.\n\nThe remainder of the packet describes the actual data of the message. The \u201cData Lengths\u201d field can be thought of as an array of type size_t, which varies in length based on the packet type. This list will always have a final value of 0, which terminates it. For each non-zero value in this list, there is an associated sequence of characters in the \u201cData\u201d field. To give a simple example, if the Data Lengths field held the array {2, 5, 0}, and the Data field held the string \u201chihello\u201d, that would signify that there are two strings in the data area of the packet (of sizes two and five respectively), and that their contents are \u201chi\u201d and \u201chello\u201d. Note that the data fields are not C strings, and do not include a terminating NUL byte! Note also that, due to ambiguity with the 0 terminating length value, no valid packet can contain a field of length 0. The sum of all data lengths in any packet must not exceed MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, as defined in src/serialize.h.\n\nThe formats of the STATISTICS and REFRESH packets do not adhere to the general form given above, but can be found in the in-depth descriptions of each of the specific packet formats below.\n\n<message>\n\nMESSAGE\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]   | size_t | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| MESSAGE | UBIT name       | msg length | 0      | msg    |\n\nThe message packet is the simplest data-carrying packet, holding only a single data field and its length. The data should be the entirety of the message input by the user including any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nNote that every character after the \u201cs\u201d in the UBIT Name field should be a NUL character, which you should remember has a integer representation of zero, and is idiomatically written as '\\0'. A message containing only ASCII space characters should not be encoded, and the pack function should instead return invalid. When decoding this packet, the resulting string should be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: Message\u201d; the above packet would decode to \u201cpagottes: My name is Peter\u201d. Note that there is both a colon and a space between the UBIT Name and the Message.\n</message>\n<status>\nSTATUS\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]      | size_t | char[] |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | status length | 0      | status |\n\nThis packet type is very similar to that of the message type; however, the data it contains differs. As previously mentioned, the status packet type is sent when the user input begins with \u201c/me\u201d followed by one or more space characters. When you encode this input you should only send the status itself, not the \u201c/me\u201d or any of the spaces between it and the next non-space character. If the user input was \u201c/me says hi\u201d, the data encoded should be simply \u201csays hi\u201d; this would be the same for a dozen spaces of separation as a single space. Like the message packet type, a status of only spaces should be considered invalid. A status should be decoded nearly the same as a message, but it should not have a colon, so it would be \u201cUBIT Name Status\u201d. If the user pagottes were to send a status resulting from the user input \u201c/me says hi\u201d, it would be decoded by a client as \u201cpagottes says hi\u201d\n</status>\n<labeled>\nLABELED\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t     | size_t        | size_t | char[]  | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LABELED | UBIT name       | msg length | target length | 0      | message | target |\n\nThe labeled packet is the most complex type to pack. You will recall that this packet type is sent when the\nuser input begins with an \u201c@\u201d, followed by one to no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by a\nspace. The characters between the \u201c@\u201d and the first space are the \u201cTarget\u201d. Note that this does not include\nthe initial character \u201c@\u201d. The characters starting with the first non-space character after the target is the\n\u201cMessage\u201d. The same rules on space characters from the previous subsection apply. Any input starting with\n\u201c@\u201d that does not match the input format for a labeled message is an invalid input.\nIf the user pagottes input the text \u201c@elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d, it would be encoded as:\n\n1. The integer LABELED\n2. The characters in \u201cpagottes\u201d padded out to NAME_SIZE bytes\n3. A size_t containing 39 (the number of characters in \u201cthe Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d)\n4. A size_t containing 3 (the number of characters in \u201celb\u201d)\n5. A size_t containing 0\n6. The 39 characters of the message\n7. The 3 characters of the target\n\nWhen decoding, the string is expected to be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: @Target Message\u201d. In the above\nexample, it would be \u201cpagottes: @elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d.\n</labeled>\n<statistics>\nSTATISTICS\n| int        | char[NAME_SIZE] | char[NAME_SIZE] | int               | int           | int           | int           |\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| STATISTICS | UBIT name       | most active     | most active count | invalid count | refresh count | message count |\n\nYou should immediately notice that the statistics packet does not conform to the general format mentioned at the beginning of this section. Instead, it stores data corresponding to the members of the statistics struct defined in serialize.h:\nstruct statistics {\nchar sender [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* Name of sender */\nint messages_count ; /* Number of packets sent to the server */\nchar most_active [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* User who has sent the most messages */\nint most_active_count ; /* Number of messages sent by that user */\nlong invalid_count ; /* Number of invalid packets sent to the server */\nlong refresh_count ; /* Number of refresh packets sent to the server */\n};\nWhen encoding the statistics packet, none of this information is available to you, so you should only populate the packet type and your own UBIT Name. When decoding, you will decode this information into a statistics structure handed to the unpack_statistics function. The given client code will handle formatting the output printed to the screen.\n</statistics>\n<packet_refresh>\n\nREFRESH\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | int        |\n|--------|-----------------|------------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | message id |\n\nThe refresh packet is another packet which does not conform to the general case. It simply stores the packet type, your UBIT (which is \"smanzur\"), and the ID of the last packet that your client received. This packet type is also special in the fact that you will only have to encode it, as it is never sent from the server to the client. Because this packet type is used in the process of communication with the server, pack_refresh() is the first thing you should implement. If this function does not work correctly, you will not receive any messages.\n</packet_refresh>\n<packet_formats>\n\n4. Using the Client\n\nWhen you start the chat client, you will be presented with a full-screen terminal application having a box at the bottom for user input. The chat client frequently calls pack_refresh() to send a REFRESH packet to the server to fetch incoming messages. Those incoming messages will be passed to unpack() to be displayed by your client. It will also accept user input and send that input to pack() when the user presses the Enter key. To exit the chat client, press Control-C.\n\n5. Guidance and hints\n\nWhen considering how you are going to implement this assignment, we highly recommend reading over Chap- ter 5 of K&R. You will also want to read the string [3] man page, which contains a description of all functions defined in string.h.\nYou will almost certainly find it helpful to draw out a few encoded packets of each type, with the appropriate values and padding in the appropriate places, and think about how you will implement code to produce that output. Consider what input the user would type to produce the packet.\nLearn how to attach gdb to your client process sooner rather than later. You will certainly find it helpful.\n\nWe recommend that, unless you have a different plan for identifiable reasons, you start by implementing pack_refresh(), and then move on to a version of pack() that handles all user input as type MESSAGE with little or no error handling, followed by unpack() capable of unpacking only MESSAGE packets. This will allow you to build out each stage using the given server (which will print errors if it receives invalid packets) and your own implementation (if you send a message, you should receive and unpack it with the expected results!) for testing. Once you have this minimal functionality in place, you can move on to the more difficult message types, error handling, and other tasks.\nRemember to take time to design, as well as to refactor your code! If you find that you are copy-and-pasting, or reimplementing, more than a line or two of code, it may be time for a helper function. This project lends itself very well to a small number of helper functions that are called in several places each.",

                "content": "Word Blocks\n===\n\nYour task is to pack a data buffer with words from an input string.\n\nRequirements\n---\n\nYou must implement the following two functions in `wordblocks.c`:\n\n`int pack_chunk(char *word, void *output)`\n\n`int wordblocks(char *input[], void *output);`\n\n### `pack_chunk`\nThis function must encode a provided word and length into a block and\nreturn the total number of bytes encoded into the buffer `output`. The\nword to pack is provided as a NUL-terminated string `word`.\n\nEach block is a 16-bit `short` containing the number of bytes in the\nencoded word, followed by the bytes of the word.  A block containing\nthe word \"Hello\" would have the following form:\n\n| short | character data          |\n|-------|-------------------------|\n|     5 | 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' |\n\nNote that there is **No terminating NUL byte** on the word Hello in the chunk!\n\n### `wordblocks`\n\nThis function must encode every \"word\" in the provided _array of strings_\n`input` as a _block_ in the buffer `output`, and return the total number\nof bytes encoded into the buffer `output`.\n\nEach word is given as a NUL-terminated string in the `input`\narray. The length of `input` is not explicitly given.  Instead, the\nend of the array is marked by the pointer NULL.  (You may find this\nformat familiar, as it is the exact format command line arguments are\npassed in via `argv`.)  Words may have a length of zero, in which case\nthe string will be an empty string.\n\nThe end of the output array is encoded as a `short` length of `-1`.\n\nThe following sentence and example encoding should help clarify this:\n\nInput: `{\"I\", \"like\", \"it.\", \"\", \"I'll\", \"take\", \"it.\"}`\n\nOutput:\n\n| 1 | I | 4 | like | 3 | it. | 0 | 4 | I'll | 4 | take | 3 | it. | -1 |\n\n(The number preceding each chunk is a 16-bit `short` integer.) This\noutput has a total length of 35 (8 2-byte short integers plus 19\nencoded word characters), and thus `wordblocks()` would return 35.\n\nTesting and Example Output\n---\n\nTyping `make` will build the program `testblocks`, which takes _a\nseries of arguments_ on the command line, calls `wordblocks()` on\nthose arguments, and writes the result to the file `words.out`.  Note\nthat it _depends on the return value of `wordblocks()` being correct_,\nand that an incorrect return value may lead to a crash or corrupt\noutput.\n\nYou can test against an input _of your choice_ by observing the\nencoded output of a sentence that you submit to `testblocks` using a\ncommand such as:\n\n`od -t x1 -a words.out`\n\nThis command will print both the hex value of every byte in the file\n`words.out` as well as its ASCII equivalent character.  For example,\nencoding the sentence \"Shop smart, shop S-Mart!\" would work as:\n\n```bash\n$ ./testblocks Shop smart, shop S-Mart!\n$ od -t x1 -a words.out\n0000000  04  00  53  68  6f  70  06  00  73  6d  61  72  74  2c  04  00\n        eot nul   S   h   o   p ack nul   s   m   a   r   t   , eot nul\n0000020  73  68  6f  70  07  00  53  2d  4d  61  72  74  21  ff  ff\n          s   h   o   p bel nul   S   -   M   a   r   t   ! del del\n0000037\n```\n\nNote that each `short` integer is represented by two bytes (the second\nof which is 0 in each of these, because no word is longer than 255\ncharacters), followed by its respective word, and that the file ends in\n`0xffff`, which we know is 2's complement for -1.\n\nEmpty words can be expressed on the command line as\n`\"\"`. Additionally, characters interpreted by the shell must be\nescaped with a backslash (`\\`). For example, to test the input\n`{\"I\", \"like\", \"it.\", \"\", \"I'll\", \"take\", \"it.\"}` you would run:\n\n```\n$ ./testblocks I like it. \"\" I\\'ll take it.\n```\n\nHints and Discussion\n---\n\nYou should start by implementing `pack_chunk`, and call your\nimplementation of `pack_chunk` from `wordblocks`. Once correctly\nimplemented, `pack_chunk` will do most of the work.\n\nSince the length of the input array is not explicitly given, you will\nneed to test for NULL as an element of the array to find the end.\n\nDo not forget to include the length fields or the terminating -1 in\nthe count of bytes written.\n\nThe `input` and `output` arrays are allocated for you by the calling\ncode.  Therefore, you need not dynamically allocate memory using\n`malloc` or `calloc`.",

                "content": "1. Introduction\nAn instant messaging application allows users to communicate via text messages in real time. Users interact with the instant messaging application through a client. When a user composes a message and sends it from their client application, that message is sent to a server which then distributes it to all of the recipient client applications. Communication between client and server is achieved by sending packets. The packets follow a specific format and carry a data payload in addition to other useful information about the message (such information is often called metadata). In this assignment, you will implement the packet encoding and decoding for a basic instant messaging protocol. You will be using void pointers and pointer arithmetic, along with functions from string.h, to accomplish this. You will learn about pointer arithmetic, raw memory access, and data serialization. This assignment only requires you to encode and decode the outgoing and incoming packets, the rest of the instant messaging application is already implemented for you. This assignment provides you with an instant messaging server and the remainder of the instant messaging application described in the previous paragraph. When the server is running, a client can connect and thereby communicate with other users also connected to that server. When the client process is started, the user\u2019s terminal window is split into two regions: a single line at the bottom where the user can type a command (the command region), and the remainder of the window at the top dedicated to the responses received from the server (the response region).\n\n2. Requirements\nIn this assignment, you must implement encoding and decoding of data packets. The packet formats used in this assignment are specified in Section 3. You will implement four functions (note that each packet passed as a void *):\n\n- int pack(void *packed, char *input):\nParse input, a well-formed C string, to determine the packet type and fill packed with the encoded input.\n- int pack_refresh(void *packed, int message_id):\nFill packed with an encoded refresh packet according to the specification in Section 3.5.\n- int unpack(char *message, void *packed):\nDecode packed based on the packet type and fill message with the decoded string.\n- int unpack_statistics(struct statistics *statistics, void *packed):\nDecode packed according to the STATISTICS format specified in Section 3.4, filling statistics with the data.\n\nYour program must parse user input and send the correct type of packet. User inputs that begin with special characters \u201c/\u201d or \u201c@\u201d may be handled specially (see Section 3). No input that begins with \u201c/\u201d that is not specified in this document will ever be tested, and you may use this to implement commands starting with slash for debugging (if it is useful to you). For each of the above functions, the return value must be the integer value of the packet type as defined in serialize.h, or -1 for invalid inputs. You should assume that any non-NULL pointer passed to a function is correctly allocated and indicates a region of memory of an adequate size. Other than that, you should not make any assumptions about the validity of inputs; you are responsible for validating them. This includes unreasonable or meaningless user input, as well as malformed data to be unpacked. Some examples of invalid values will be described in Section 3.\n\n3. Packet formats\nthe following is information of the format and structure of the packets, encapsulated in XML tags for clarity.\n<packet_formats>\nThe instant messenger application defines several packet types:\n- STATUS\nThis packet type sets your status on the server. It should be sent when the user input starts with \u201c/me\u201d\nfollowed by a space. Any input starting with \u201c/me\u201d followed by any other character is invalid.\n- LABELED\nThis packet type tags another user. It is sent when the user input starts with \u201c@\u201d followed by at least\none and no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by an ASCII space. NAME_SIZE is defined in\nsrc/serialize.h.\n- STATISTICS\nThis packet type is used to request and receive a set of basic statistics from the server. It is sent when\nthe user input starts with \u201c/stats\u201d followed by the end of the input. Any input beginning with \u201c/stats\u201d\nfollowed by any other character is invalid.\n- MESSAGE\nThis packet type is just a normal text message sent by a user. It should be sent if the user input does not\nfall into any of the above categories.\n- REFRESH\nThis packet is sent to the server by the client to request new messages to decode. This packet is different\nfrom the others in that it is sent once every second and has no relation to user input.\n\nNote that the formats in this assignment are very specific, and must be implemented precisely. This includes details such as white space and the value of padding bytes. Be sure not to include any extra characters in quoted strings, insert extra newlines or other formatting, or deviate from this specification in any way!\nThe STATUS, LABELED, and MESSAGE packets have the following general form:\n| int         | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]     | size_t | char[] |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| packet type | UBIT name       | data lengths | 0      | data   |\n\nThe first part of the packet is common among the different packet types. It starts with an integer value indicating the packet type. This would be one of the packet types described above (REFRESH, MESSAGE, etc.), as defined in serialize.h. Following this is a character array of exactly NAME_SIZE bytes, (NAME_SIZE is also defined in serialize.h). This character array is valid if and only if it contains the sender\u2019s UBIT Name followed by sufficient ASCII NUL bytes to fill out the NAME_SIZE bytes of the array.\n\nThe remainder of the packet describes the actual data of the message. The \u201cData Lengths\u201d field can be thought of as an array of type size_t, which varies in length based on the packet type. This list will always have a final value of 0, which terminates it. For each non-zero value in this list, there is an associated sequence of characters in the \u201cData\u201d field. To give a simple example, if the Data Lengths field held the array {2, 5, 0}, and the Data field held the string \u201chihello\u201d, that would signify that there are two strings in the data area of the packet (of sizes two and five respectively), and that their contents are \u201chi\u201d and \u201chello\u201d. Note that the data fields are not C strings, and do not include a terminating NUL byte! Note also that, due to ambiguity with the 0 terminating length value, no valid packet can contain a field of length 0. The sum of all data lengths in any packet must not exceed MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, as defined in src/serialize.h.\n\nThe formats of the STATISTICS and REFRESH packets do not adhere to the general form given above, but can be found in the in-depth descriptions of each of the specific packet formats below.\n\n<message>\n\nMESSAGE\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]   | size_t | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| MESSAGE | UBIT name       | msg length | 0      | msg    |\n\nThe message packet is the simplest data-carrying packet, holding only a single data field and its length. The data should be the entirety of the message input by the user including any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nNote that every character after the \u201cs\u201d in the UBIT Name field should be a NUL character, which you should remember has a integer representation of zero, and is idiomatically written as '\\0'. A message containing only ASCII space characters should not be encoded, and the pack function should instead return invalid. When decoding this packet, the resulting string should be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: Message\u201d; the above packet would decode to \u201cpagottes: My name is Peter\u201d. Note that there is both a colon and a space between the UBIT Name and the Message.\n</message>\n<status>\nSTATUS\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]      | size_t | char[] |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | status length | 0      | status |\n\nThis packet type is very similar to that of the message type; however, the data it contains differs. As previously mentioned, the status packet type is sent when the user input begins with \u201c/me\u201d followed by one or more space characters. When you encode this input you should only send the status itself, not the \u201c/me\u201d or any of the spaces between it and the next non-space character. If the user input was \u201c/me says hi\u201d, the data encoded should be simply \u201csays hi\u201d; this would be the same for a dozen spaces of separation as a single space. Like the message packet type, a status of only spaces should be considered invalid. A status should be decoded nearly the same as a message, but it should not have a colon, so it would be \u201cUBIT Name Status\u201d. If the user pagottes were to send a status resulting from the user input \u201c/me says hi\u201d, it would be decoded by a client as \u201cpagottes says hi\u201d\n</status>\n<labeled>\nLABELED\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t     | size_t        | size_t | char[]  | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LABELED | UBIT name       | msg length | target length | 0      | message | target |\n\nThe labeled packet is the most complex type to pack. You will recall that this packet type is sent when the\nuser input begins with an \u201c@\u201d, followed by one to no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by a\nspace. The characters between the \u201c@\u201d and the first space are the \u201cTarget\u201d. Note that this does not include\nthe initial character \u201c@\u201d. The characters starting with the first non-space character after the target is the\n\u201cMessage\u201d. The same rules on space characters from the previous subsection apply. Any input starting with\n\u201c@\u201d that does not match the input format for a labeled message is an invalid input.\nIf the user pagottes input the text \u201c@elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d, it would be encoded as:\n\n1. The integer LABELED\n2. The characters in \u201cpagottes\u201d padded out to NAME_SIZE bytes\n3. A size_t containing 39 (the number of characters in \u201cthe Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d)\n4. A size_t containing 3 (the number of characters in \u201celb\u201d)\n5. A size_t containing 0\n6. The 39 characters of the message\n7. The 3 characters of the target\n\nWhen decoding, the string is expected to be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: @Target Message\u201d. In the above\nexample, it would be \u201cpagottes: @elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d.\n</labeled>\n<statistics>\nSTATISTICS\n| int        | char[NAME_SIZE] | char[NAME_SIZE] | int               | int           | int           | int           |\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| STATISTICS | UBIT name       | most active     | most active count | invalid count | refresh count | message count |\n\nYou should immediately notice that the statistics packet does not conform to the general format mentioned at the beginning of this section. Instead, it stores data corresponding to the members of the statistics struct defined in serialize.h:\nstruct statistics {\nchar sender [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* Name of sender */\nint messages_count ; /* Number of packets sent to the server */\nchar most_active [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* User who has sent the most messages */\nint most_active_count ; /* Number of messages sent by that user */\nlong invalid_count ; /* Number of invalid packets sent to the server */\nlong refresh_count ; /* Number of refresh packets sent to the server */\n};\nWhen encoding the statistics packet, none of this information is available to you, so you should only populate the packet type and your own UBIT Name. When decoding, you will decode this information into a statistics structure handed to the unpack_statistics function. The given client code will handle formatting the output printed to the screen.\n</statistics>\n<packet_refresh>\n\nREFRESH\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | int        |\n|--------|-----------------|------------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | message id |\n\nThe refresh packet is another packet which does not conform to the general case. It simply stores the packet type, your UBIT (which is \"smanzur\"), and the ID of the last packet that your client received. This packet type is also special in the fact that you will only have to encode it, as it is never sent from the server to the client. Because this packet type is used in the process of communication with the server, pack_refresh() is the first thing you should implement. If this function does not work correctly, you will not receive any messages.\n</packet_refresh>\n<packet_formats>\n\n4. Using the Client\n\nWhen you start the chat client, you will be presented with a full-screen terminal application having a box at the bottom for user input. The chat client frequently calls pack_refresh() to send a REFRESH packet to the server to fetch incoming messages. Those incoming messages will be passed to unpack() to be displayed by your client. It will also accept user input and send that input to pack() when the user presses the Enter key. To exit the chat client, press Control-C.\n\n5. Guidance and hints\n\nWhen considering how you are going to implement this assignment, we highly recommend reading over Chapter 5 of K&R. You will also want to read the string [3] man page, which contains a description of all functions defined in string.h.\nYou will almost certainly find it helpful to draw out a few encoded packets of each type, with the appropriate values and padding in the appropriate places, and think about how you will implement code to produce that output. Consider what input the user would type to produce the packet.\n",

                "content": "1. Introduction\nAn instant messaging application allows users to communicate via text messages in real time. Users interact with the instant messaging application through a client. When a user composes a message and sends it from their client application, that message is sent to a server which then distributes it to all of the recipient client applications. Communication between client and server is achieved by sending packets. The packets follow a specific format and carry a data payload in addition to other useful information about the message (such information is often called metadata). In this assignment, you will implement the packet encoding and decoding for a basic instant messaging protocol. You will be using void pointers and pointer arithmetic, along with functions from string.h, to accomplish this. You will learn about pointer arithmetic, raw memory access, and data serialization. This assignment only requires you to encode and decode the outgoing and incoming packets, the rest of the instant messaging application is already implemented for you. This assignment provides you with an instant messaging server and the remainder of the instant messaging application described in the previous paragraph. When the server is running, a client can connect and thereby communicate with other users also connected to that server. When the client process is started, the user\u2019s terminal window is split into two regions: a single line at the bottom where the user can type a command (the command region), and the remainder of the window at the top dedicated to the responses received from the server (the response region).\n\n2. Requirements\nIn this assignment, you must implement encoding and decoding of data packets. The packet formats used in this assignment are specified in Section 3. You will implement four functions (note that each packet passed as a void *):\n\n- int pack(void *packed, char *input):\nParse input, a well-formed C string, to determine the packet type and fill packed with the encoded input.\n- int pack_refresh(void *packed, int message_id):\nFill packed with an encoded refresh packet according to the specification in Section 3.5.\n- int unpack(char *message, void *packed):\nDecode packed based on the packet type and fill message with the decoded string.\n- int unpack_statistics(struct statistics *statistics, void *packed):\nDecode packed according to the STATISTICS format specified in Section 3.4, filling statistics with the data.\n\nYour program must parse user input and send the correct type of packet. User inputs that begin with special characters \u201c/\u201d or \u201c@\u201d may be handled specially (see Section 3). No input that begins with \u201c/\u201d that is not specified in this document will ever be tested, and you may use this to implement commands starting with slash for debugging (if it is useful to you). For each of the above functions, the return value must be the integer value of the packet type as defined in serialize.h, or -1 for invalid inputs. You should assume that any non-NULL pointer passed to a function is correctly allocated and indicates a region of memory of an adequate size. Other than that, you should not make any assumptions about the validity of inputs; you are responsible for validating them. This includes unreasonable or meaningless user input, as well as malformed data to be unpacked. Some examples of invalid values will be described in Section 3.\n\n3. Packet formats\nthe following is information of the format and structure of the packets, encapsulated in XML tags for clarity.\n<packet_formats>\nThe instant messenger application defines several packet types:\n- STATUS\nThis packet type sets your status on the server. It should be sent when the user input starts with \u201c/me\u201d\nfollowed by a space. Any input starting with \u201c/me\u201d followed by any other character is invalid.\n- LABELED\nThis packet type tags another user. It is sent when the user input starts with \u201c@\u201d followed by at least\none and no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by an ASCII space. NAME_SIZE is defined in\nsrc/serialize.h.\n- STATISTICS\nThis packet type is used to request and receive a set of basic statistics from the server. It is sent when\nthe user input starts with \u201c/stats\u201d followed by the end of the input. Any input beginning with \u201c/stats\u201d\nfollowed by any other character is invalid.\n- MESSAGE\nThis packet type is just a normal text message sent by a user. It should be sent if the user input does not\nfall into any of the above categories.\n- REFRESH\nThis packet is sent to the server by the client to request new messages to decode. This packet is different\nfrom the others in that it is sent once every second and has no relation to user input.\n\nNote that the formats in this assignment are very specific, and must be implemented precisely. This includes details such as white space and the value of padding bytes. Be sure not to include any extra characters in quoted strings, insert extra newlines or other formatting, or deviate from this specification in any way!\nThe STATUS, LABELED, and MESSAGE packets have the following general form:\n| int         | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]     | size_t | char[] |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| packet type | UBIT name       | data lengths | 0      | data   |\n\nThe first part of the packet is common among the different packet types. It starts with an integer value indicating the packet type. This would be one of the packet types described above (REFRESH, MESSAGE, etc.), as defined in serialize.h. Following this is a character array of exactly NAME_SIZE bytes, (NAME_SIZE is also defined in serialize.h). This character array is valid if and only if it contains the sender\u2019s UBIT Name followed by sufficient ASCII NUL bytes to fill out the NAME_SIZE bytes of the array.\n\nThe remainder of the packet describes the actual data of the message. The \u201cData Lengths\u201d field can be thought of as an array of type size_t, which varies in length based on the packet type. This list will always have a final value of 0, which terminates it. For each non-zero value in this list, there is an associated sequence of characters in the \u201cData\u201d field. To give a simple example, if the Data Lengths field held the array {2, 5, 0}, and the Data field held the string \u201chihello\u201d, that would signify that there are two strings in the data area of the packet (of sizes two and five respectively), and that their contents are \u201chi\u201d and \u201chello\u201d. Note that the data fields are not C strings, and do not include a terminating NUL byte! Note also that, due to ambiguity with the 0 terminating length value, no valid packet can contain a field of length 0. The sum of all data lengths in any packet must not exceed MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, as defined in src/serialize.h.\n\nThe formats of the STATISTICS and REFRESH packets do not adhere to the general form given above, but can be found in the in-depth descriptions of each of the specific packet formats below.\n\n<message>\n\nMESSAGE\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]   | size_t | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| MESSAGE | UBIT name       | msg length | 0      | msg    |\n\nThe message packet is the simplest data-carrying packet, holding only a single data field and its length. The data should be the entirety of the message input by the user including any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nNote that every character after the \u201cs\u201d in the UBIT Name field should be a NUL character, which you should remember has a integer representation of zero, and is idiomatically written as '\\0'. A message containing only ASCII space characters should not be encoded, and the pack function should instead return invalid. When decoding this packet, the resulting string should be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: Message\u201d; the above packet would decode to \u201cpagottes: My name is Peter\u201d. Note that there is both a colon and a space between the UBIT Name and the Message.\n</message>\n<status>\nSTATUS\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]      | size_t | char[] |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | status length | 0      | status |\n\nThis packet type is very similar to that of the message type; however, the data it contains differs. As previously mentioned, the status packet type is sent when the user input begins with \u201c/me\u201d followed by one or more space characters. When you encode this input you should only send the status itself, not the \u201c/me\u201d or any of the spaces between it and the next non-space character. If the user input was \u201c/me says hi\u201d, the data encoded should be simply \u201csays hi\u201d; this would be the same for a dozen spaces of separation as a single space. Like the message packet type, a status of only spaces should be considered invalid. A status should be decoded nearly the same as a message, but it should not have a colon, so it would be \u201cUBIT Name Status\u201d. If the user pagottes were to send a status resulting from the user input \u201c/me says hi\u201d, it would be decoded by a client as \u201cpagottes says hi\u201d\n</status>\n<labeled>\nLABELED\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t     | size_t        | size_t | char[]  | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LABELED | UBIT name       | msg length | target length | 0      | message | target |\n\nThe labeled packet is the most complex type to pack. You will recall that this packet type is sent when the\nuser input begins with an \u201c@\u201d, followed by one to no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by a\nspace. The characters between the \u201c@\u201d and the first space are the \u201cTarget\u201d. Note that this does not include\nthe initial character \u201c@\u201d. The characters starting with the first non-space character after the target is the\n\u201cMessage\u201d. The same rules on space characters from the previous subsection apply. Any input starting with\n\u201c@\u201d that does not match the input format for a labeled message is an invalid input.\nIf the user pagottes input the text \u201c@elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d, it would be encoded as:\n\n1. The integer LABELED\n2. The characters in \u201cpagottes\u201d padded out to NAME_SIZE bytes\n3. A size_t containing 39 (the number of characters in \u201cthe Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d)\n4. A size_t containing 3 (the number of characters in \u201celb\u201d)\n5. A size_t containing 0\n6. The 39 characters of the message\n7. The 3 characters of the target\n\nWhen decoding, the string is expected to be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: @Target Message\u201d. In the above\nexample, it would be \u201cpagottes: @elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d.\n</labeled>\n<statistics>\nSTATISTICS\n| int        | char[NAME_SIZE] | char[NAME_SIZE] | int               | int           | int           | int           |\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| STATISTICS | UBIT name       | most active     | most active count | invalid count | refresh count | message count |\n\nYou should immediately notice that the statistics packet does not conform to the general format mentioned at the beginning of this section. Instead, it stores data corresponding to the members of the statistics struct defined in serialize.h:\nstruct statistics {\nchar sender [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* Name of sender */\nint messages_count ; /* Number of packets sent to the server */\nchar most_active [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* User who has sent the most messages */\nint most_active_count ; /* Number of messages sent by that user */\nlong invalid_count ; /* Number of invalid packets sent to the server */\nlong refresh_count ; /* Number of refresh packets sent to the server */\n};\nWhen encoding the statistics packet, none of this information is available to you, so you should only populate the packet type and your own UBIT Name. When decoding, you will decode this information into a statistics structure handed to the unpack_statistics function. The given client code will handle formatting the output printed to the screen.\n</statistics>\n<packet_refresh>\n\nREFRESH\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | int        |\n|--------|-----------------|------------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | message id |\n\nThe refresh packet is another packet which does not conform to the general case. It simply stores the packet type, your UBIT (which is \"smanzur\"), and the ID of the last packet that your client received. This packet type is also special in the fact that you will only have to encode it, as it is never sent from the server to the client. Because this packet type is used in the process of communication with the server, pack_refresh() is the first thing you should implement. If this function does not work correctly, you will not receive any messages.\n</packet_refresh>\n<packet_formats>\n\n4. Using the Client\n\nWhen you start the chat client, you will be presented with a full-screen terminal application having a box at the bottom for user input. The chat client frequently calls pack_refresh() to send a REFRESH packet to the server to fetch incoming messages. Those incoming messages will be passed to unpack() to be displayed by your client. It will also accept user input and send that input to pack() when the user presses the Enter key. To exit the chat client, press Control-C.\n\n5. Guidance and hints\n\nWhen considering how you are going to implement this assignment, we highly recommend reading over Chapter 5 of K&R. You will also want to read the string [3] man page, which contains a description of all functions defined in string.h.\nYou will almost certainly find it helpful to draw out a few encoded packets of each type, with the appropriate values and padding in the appropriate places, and think about how you will implement code to produce that output. Consider what input the user would type to produce the packet.\nLearn how to attach gdb to your client process sooner rather than later. You will certainly find it helpful.\n\nWe recommend that, unless you have a different plan for identifiable reasons, you start by implementing pack_refresh(), and then move on to a version of pack() that handles all user input as type MESSAGE with little or no error handling, followed by unpack() capable of unpacking only MESSAGE packets. This will allow you to build out each stage using the given server (which will print errors if it receives invalid packets) and your own implementation (if you send a message, you should receive and unpack it with the expected results!) for testing. Once you have this minimal functionality in place, you can move on to the more difficult message types, error handling, and other tasks.\nRemember to take time to design, as well as to refactor your code! If you find that you are copy-and-pasting, or reimplementing, more than a line or two of code, it may be time for a helper function. This project lends itself very well to a small number of helper functions that are called in several places each.",

User inputs that begin with special characters \u201c/\u201d or \u201c@\u201d may be handled specially (see Section 3). No input that begins with \u201c/\u201d that is not specified in this document will ever be tested, and you may use this to implement commands starting with slash for debugging (if it is useful to you). For each of the above functions, the return value must be the integer value of the packet type as defined in serialize.h, or -1 for invalid inputs. You should assume that any non-NULL pointer passed to a function is correctly allocated and indicates a region of memory of an adequate size. Other than that, you should not make any assumptions about the validity of inputs; you are responsible for validating them. This includes unreasonable or meaningless user input, as well as malformed data to be unpacked. Some examples of invalid values will be described in Section 3.\n\n3. Packet formats\nthe following is information of the format and structure of the packets, encapsulated in XML tags for clarity.\n<packet_formats>\nThe instant messenger application defines several packet types:\n- STATUS\nThis packet type sets your status on the server. It should be sent when the user input starts with \u201c/me\u201d\nfollowed by a space. Any input starting with \u201c/me\u201d followed by any other character is invalid.\n- LABELED\nThis packet type tags another user. It is sent when the user input starts with \u201c@\u201d followed by at least\none and no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by an ASCII space. NAME_SIZE is defined in\nsrc/serialize.h.\n- STATISTICS\nThis packet type is used to request and receive a set of basic statistics from the server. It is sent when\nthe user input starts with \u201c/stats\u201d followed by the end of the input. Any input beginning with \u201c/stats\u201d\nfollowed by any other character is invalid.\n- MESSAGE\nThis packet type is just a normal text message sent by a user. It should be sent if the user input does not\nfall into any of the above categories.\n- REFRESH\nThis packet is sent to the server by the client to request new messages to decode. This packet is different\nfrom the others in that it is sent once every second and has no relation to user input.\n\nNote that the formats in this assignment are very specific, and must be implemented precisely. This includes details such as white space and the value of padding bytes. Be sure not to include any extra characters in quoted strings, insert extra newlines or other formatting, or deviate from this specification in any way!\nThe STATUS, LABELED, and MESSAGE packets have the following general form:\n| int         | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]     | size_t | char[] |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| packet type | UBIT name       | data lengths | 0      | data   |\n\nThe first part of the packet is common among the different packet types. It starts with an integer value indicating the packet type. This would be one of the packet types described above (REFRESH, MESSAGE, etc.), as defined in serialize.h. Following this is a character array of exactly NAME_SIZE bytes, (NAME_SIZE is also defined in serialize.h). This character array is valid if and only if it contains the sender\u2019s UBIT Name followed by sufficient ASCII NUL bytes to fill out the NAME_SIZE bytes of the array.\n\nThe remainder of the packet describes the actual data of the message. The \u201cData Lengths\u201d field can be thought of as an array of type size_t, which varies in length based on the packet type. This list will always have a final value of 0, which terminates it. For each non-zero value in this list, there is an associated sequence of characters in the \u201cData\u201d field. To give a simple example, if the Data Lengths field held the array {2, 5, 0}, and the Data field held the string \u201chihello\u201d, that would signify that there are two strings in the data area of the packet (of sizes two and five respectively), and that their contents are \u201chi\u201d and \u201chello\u201d. Note that the data fields are not C strings, and do not include a terminating NUL byte! Note also that, due to ambiguity with the 0 terminating length value, no valid packet can contain a field of length 0. The sum of all data lengths in any packet must not exceed MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, as defined in src/serialize.h.\n\nThe formats of the STATISTICS and REFRESH packets do not adhere to the general form given above, but can be found in the in-depth descriptions of each of the specific packet formats below.\n\n<message>\n\nMESSAGE\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]   | size_t | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| MESSAGE | UBIT name       | msg length | 0      | msg    |\n\nThe message packet is the simplest data-carrying packet, holding only a single data field and its length. The data should be the entirety of the message input by the user including any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nNote that every character after the \u201cs\u201d in the UBIT Name field should be a NUL character, which you should remember has a integer representation of zero, and is idiomatically written as '\\0'. A message containing only ASCII space characters should not be encoded, and the pack function should instead return invalid. When decoding this packet, the resulting string should be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: Message\u201d; the above packet would decode to \u201cpagottes: My name is Peter\u201d. Note that there is both a colon and a space between the UBIT Name and the Message.\n</message>\n<status>\nSTATUS\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]      | size_t | char[] |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | status length | 0      | status |\n\nThis packet type is very similar to that of the message type; however, the data it contains differs. As previously mentioned, the status packet type is sent when the user input begins with \u201c/me\u201d followed by one or more space characters. When you encode this input you should only send the status itself, not the \u201c/me\u201d or any of the spaces between it and the next non-space character. If the user input was \u201c/me says hi\u201d, the data encoded should be simply \u201csays hi\u201d; this would be the same for a dozen spaces of separation as a single space. Like the message packet type, a status of only spaces should be considered invalid. A status should be decoded nearly the same as a message, but it should not have a colon, so it would be \u201cUBIT Name Status\u201d. If the user pagottes were to send a status resulting from the user input \u201c/me says hi\u201d, it would be decoded by a client as \u201cpagottes says hi\u201d\n</status>\n<labeled>\nLABELED\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t     | size_t        | size_t | char[]  | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LABELED | UBIT name       | msg length | target length | 0      | message | target |\n\nThe labeled packet is the most complex type to pack. You will recall that this packet type is sent when the\nuser input begins with an \u201c@\u201d, followed by one to no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by a\nspace. The characters between the \u201c@\u201d and the first space are the \u201cTarget\u201d. Note that this does not include\nthe initial character \u201c@\u201d. The characters starting with the first non-space character after the target is the\n\u201cMessage\u201d. The same rules on space characters from the previous subsection apply. Any input starting with\n\u201c@\u201d that does not match the input format for a labeled message is an invalid input.\nIf the user pagottes input the text \u201c@elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d, it would be encoded as:\n\n1. The integer LABELED\n2. The characters in \u201cpagottes\u201d padded out to NAME_SIZE bytes\n3. A size_t containing 39 (the number of characters in \u201cthe Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d)\n4. A size_t containing 3 (the number of characters in \u201celb\u201d)\n5. A size_t containing 0\n6. The 39 characters of the message\n7. The 3 characters of the target\n\nWhen decoding, the string is expected to be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: @Target Message\u201d. In the above\nexample, it would be \u201cpagottes: @elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d.\n</labeled>\n<statistics>\nSTATISTICS\n| int        | char[NAME_SIZE] | char[NAME_SIZE] | int               | int           | int           | int           |\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| STATISTICS | UBIT name       | most active     | most active count | invalid count | refresh count | message count |\n\nYou should immediately notice that the statistics packet does not conform to the general format mentioned at the beginning of this section. Instead, it stores data corresponding to the members of the statistics struct defined in serialize.h:\nstruct statistics {\nchar sender [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* Name of sender */\nint messages_count ; /* Number of packets sent to the server */\nchar most_active [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* User who has sent the most messages */\nint most_active_count ; /* Number of messages sent by that user */\nlong invalid_count ; /* Number of invalid packets sent to the server */\nlong refresh_count ; /* Number of refresh packets sent to the server */\n};\nWhen encoding the statistics packet, none of this information is available to you, so you should only populate the packet type and your own UBIT Name. When decoding, you will decode this information into a statistics structure handed to the unpack_statistics function. The given client code will handle formatting the output printed to the screen.\n</statistics>\n<packet_refresh>\n\nREFRESH\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | int        |\n|--------|-----------------|------------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | message id |\n\nThe refresh packet is another packet which does not conform to the general case. It simply stores the packet type, your UBIT (which is \"smanzur\"), and the ID of the last packet that your client received. This packet type is also special in the fact that you will only have to encode it, as it is never sent from the server to the client. Because this packet type is used in the process of communication with the server, pack_refresh() is the first thing you should implement. If this function does not work correctly, you will not receive any messages.\n</packet_refresh>\n<packet_formats>\n\n4. Using the Client\n\nWhen you start the chat client, you will be presented with a full-screen terminal application having a box at the bottom for user input. The chat client frequently calls pack_refresh() to send a REFRESH packet to the server to fetch incoming messages. Those incoming messages will be passed to unpack() to be displayed by your client. It will also accept user input and send that input to pack() when the user presses the Enter key. To exit the chat client, press Control-C.\n\n5. Guidance and hints\n\nWhen considering how you are going to implement this assignment, we highly recommend reading over Chapter 5 of K&R. You will also want to read the string [3] man page, which contains a description of all functions defined in string.h.\nYou will almost certainly find it helpful to draw out a few encoded packets of each type, with the appropriate values and padding in the appropriate places, and think about how you will implement code to produce that output. Consider what input the user would type to produce the packet.\nLearn how to attach gdb to your client process sooner rather than later. You will certainly find it helpful.\n\nWe recommend that, unless you have a different plan for identifiable reasons, you start by implementing pack_refresh(), and then move on to a version of pack() that handles all user input as type MESSAGE with little or no error handling, followed by unpack() capable of unpacking only MESSAGE packets. This will allow you to build out each stage using the given server (which will print errors if it receives invalid packets) and your own implementation (if you send a message, you should receive and unpack it with the expected results!) for testing. Once you have this minimal functionality in place, you can move on to the more difficult message types, error handling, and other tasks.\nRemember to take time to design, as well as to refactor your code! If you find that you are copy-and-pasting, or reimplementing, more than a line or two of code, it may be time for a helper function. This project lends itself very well to a small number of helper functions that are called in several places each.",

                "content": "1. Introduction\nAn instant messaging application allows users to communicate via text messages in real time. Users interact with the instant messaging application through a client. When a user composes a message and sends it from their client application, that message is sent to a server which then distributes it to all of the recipient client applications. Communication between client and server is achieved by sending packets. The packets follow a specific format and carry a data payload in addition to other useful information about the message (such information is often called metadata). In this assignment, you will implement the packet encoding and decoding for a basic instant messaging protocol. You will be using void pointers and pointer arithmetic, along with functions from string.h, to accomplish this. You will learn about pointer arithmetic, raw memory access, and data serialization. This assignment only requires you to encode and decode the outgoing and incoming packets, the rest of the instant messaging application is already implemented for you. This assignment provides you with an instant messaging server and the remainder of the instant messaging application described in the previous paragraph. When the server is running, a client can connect and thereby communicate with other users also connected to that server. When the client process is started, the user\u2019s terminal window is split into two regions: a single line at the bottom where the user can type a command (the command region), and the remainder of the window at the top dedicated to the responses received from the server (the response region).\n\n2. Requirements\nIn this assignment, you must implement encoding and decoding of data packets. The packet formats used in this assignment are specified in Section 3. You will implement four functions (note that each packet passed as a void *):\n\n- int pack(void *packed, char *input):\nParse input, a well-formed C string, to determine the packet type and fill packed with the encoded input.\n- int pack_refresh(void *packed, int message_id):\nFill packed with an encoded refresh packet according to the specification in Section 3.5.\n- int unpack(char *message, void *packed):\nDecode packed based on the packet type and fill message with the decoded string.\n- int unpack_statistics(struct statistics *statistics, void *packed):\nDecode packed according to the STATISTICS format specified in Section 3.4, filling statistics with the data.\n\nYour program must parse user input and send the correct type of packet. User inputs that begin with special characters \u201c/\u201d or \u201c@\u201d may be handled specially (see Section 3). No input that begins with \u201c/\u201d that is not specified in this document will ever be tested, and you may use this to implement commands starting with slash for debugging (if it is useful to you). For each of the above functions, the return value must be the integer value of the packet type as defined in serialize.h, or -1 for invalid inputs. You should assume that any non-NULL pointer passed to a function is correctly allocated and indicates a region of memory of an adequate size. Other than that, you should not make any assumptions about the validity of inputs; you are responsible for validating them. This includes unreasonable or meaningless user input, as well as malformed data to be unpacked. Some examples of invalid values will be described in Section 3.\n\n3. Packet formats\nthe following is information of the format and structure of the packets, encapsulated in XML tags for clarity.\n<packet_formats>\nThe instant messenger application defines several packet types:\n- STATUS\nThis packet type sets your status on the server. It should be sent when the user input starts with \u201c/me\u201d\nfollowed by a space. Any input starting with \u201c/me\u201d followed by any other character is invalid.\n- LABELED\nThis packet type tags another user. It is sent when the user input starts with \u201c@\u201d followed by at least\none and no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by an ASCII space. NAME_SIZE is defined in\nsrc/serialize.h.\n- STATISTICS\nThis packet type is used to request and receive a set of basic statistics from the server. It is sent when\nthe user input starts with \u201c/stats\u201d followed by the end of the input. Any input beginning with \u201c/stats\u201d\nfollowed by any other character is invalid.\n- MESSAGE\nThis packet type is just a normal text message sent by a user. It should be sent if the user input does not\nfall into any of the above categories.\n- REFRESH\nThis packet is sent to the server by the client to request new messages to decode. This packet is different\nfrom the others in that it is sent once every second and has no relation to user input.\n\nNote that the formats in this assignment are very specific, and must be implemented precisely. This includes details such as white space and the value of padding bytes. Be sure not to include any extra characters in quoted strings, insert extra newlines or other formatting, or deviate from this specification in any way!\nThe STATUS, LABELED, and MESSAGE packets have the following general form:\n| int         | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]     | size_t | char[] |\n|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| packet type | UBIT name       | data lengths | 0      | data   |\n\nThe first part of the packet is common among the different packet types. It starts with an integer value indicating the packet type. This would be one of the packet types described above (REFRESH, MESSAGE, etc.), as defined in serialize.h. Following this is a character array of exactly NAME_SIZE bytes, (NAME_SIZE is also defined in serialize.h). This character array is valid if and only if it contains the sender\u2019s UBIT Name followed by sufficient ASCII NUL bytes to fill out the NAME_SIZE bytes of the array.\n\nThe remainder of the packet describes the actual data of the message. The \u201cData Lengths\u201d field can be thought of as an array of type size_t, which varies in length based on the packet type. This list will always have a final value of 0, which terminates it. For each non-zero value in this list, there is an associated sequence of characters in the \u201cData\u201d field. To give a simple example, if the Data Lengths field held the array {2, 5, 0}, and the Data field held the string \u201chihello\u201d, that would signify that there are two strings in the data area of the packet (of sizes two and five respectively), and that their contents are \u201chi\u201d and \u201chello\u201d. Note that the data fields are not C strings, and do not include a terminating NUL byte! Note also that, due to ambiguity with the 0 terminating length value, no valid packet can contain a field of length 0. The sum of all data lengths in any packet must not exceed MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, as defined in src/serialize.h.\n\nThe formats of the STATISTICS and REFRESH packets do not adhere to the general form given above, but can be found in the in-depth descriptions of each of the specific packet formats below.\n\n<message>\n\nMESSAGE\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]   | size_t | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|--------|--------|\n| MESSAGE | UBIT name       | msg length | 0      | msg    |\n\nThe message packet is the simplest data-carrying packet, holding only a single data field and its length. The data should be the entirety of the message input by the user including any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nNote that every character after the \u201cs\u201d in the UBIT Name field should be a NUL character, which you should remember has a integer representation of zero, and is idiomatically written as '\\0'. A message containing only ASCII space characters should not be encoded, and the pack function should instead return invalid. When decoding this packet, the resulting string should be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: Message\u201d; the above packet would decode to \u201cpagottes: My name is Peter\u201d. Note that there is both a colon and a space between the UBIT Name and the Message.\n</message>\n<status>\nSTATUS\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t[]      | size_t | char[] |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | status length | 0      | status |\n\nThis packet type is very similar to that of the message type; however, the data it contains differs. As previously mentioned, the status packet type is sent when the user input begins with \u201c/me\u201d followed by one or more space characters. When you encode this input you should only send the status itself, not the \u201c/me\u201d or any of the spaces between it and the next non-space character. If the user input was \u201c/me says hi\u201d, the data encoded should be simply \u201csays hi\u201d; this would be the same for a dozen spaces of separation as a single space. Like the message packet type, a status of only spaces should be considered invalid. A status should be decoded nearly the same as a message, but it should not have a colon, so it would be \u201cUBIT Name Status\u201d. If the user pagottes were to send a status resulting from the user input \u201c/me says hi\u201d, it would be decoded by a client as \u201cpagottes says hi\u201d\n</status>\n<labeled>\nLABELED\n| int     | char[NAME_SIZE] | size_t     | size_t        | size_t | char[]  | char[] |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LABELED | UBIT name       | msg length | target length | 0      | message | target |\n\nThe labeled packet is the most complex type to pack. You will recall that this packet type is sent when the\nuser input begins with an \u201c@\u201d, followed by one to no more than NAME_SIZE non-space characters, followed by a\nspace. The characters between the \u201c@\u201d and the first space are the \u201cTarget\u201d. Note that this does not include\nthe initial character \u201c@\u201d. The characters starting with the first non-space character after the target is the\n\u201cMessage\u201d. The same rules on space characters from the previous subsection apply. Any input starting with\n\u201c@\u201d that does not match the input format for a labeled message is an invalid input.\nIf the user pagottes input the text \u201c@elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d, it would be encoded as:\n\n1. The integer LABELED\n2. The characters in \u201cpagottes\u201d padded out to NAME_SIZE bytes\n3. A size_t containing 39 (the number of characters in \u201cthe Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d)\n4. A size_t containing 3 (the number of characters in \u201celb\u201d)\n5. A size_t containing 0\n6. The 39 characters of the message\n7. The 3 characters of the target\n\nWhen decoding, the string is expected to be of the form \u201cUBIT Name: @Target Message\u201d. In the above\nexample, it would be \u201cpagottes: @elb the Offspring is basically ska but good\u201d.\n</labeled>\n<statistics>\nSTATISTICS\n| int        | char[NAME_SIZE] | char[NAME_SIZE] | int               | int           | int           | int           |\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| STATISTICS | UBIT name       | most active     | most active count | invalid count | refresh count | message count |\n\nYou should immediately notice that the statistics packet does not conform to the general format mentioned at the beginning of this section. Instead, it stores data corresponding to the members of the statistics struct defined in serialize.h:\nstruct statistics {\nchar sender [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* Name of sender */\nint messages_count ; /* Number of packets sent to the server */\nchar most_active [ NAME_SIZE +1]; /* User who has sent the most messages */\nint most_active_count ; /* Number of messages sent by that user */\nlong invalid_count ; /* Number of invalid packets sent to the server */\nlong refresh_count ; /* Number of refresh packets sent to the server */\n};\nWhen encoding the statistics packet, none of this information is available to you, so you should only populate the packet type and your own UBIT Name. When decoding, you will decode this information into a statistics structure handed to the unpack_statistics function. The given client code will handle formatting the output printed to the screen.\n</statistics>\n<packet_refresh>\n\nREFRESH\n| int    | char[NAME_SIZE] | int        |\n|--------|-----------------|------------|\n| STATUS | UBIT name       | message id |\n\nThe refresh packet is another packet which does not conform to the general case. It simply stores the packet type, your UBIT (which is \"smanzur\"), and the ID of the last packet that your client received. This packet type is also special in the fact that you will only have to encode it, as it is never sent from the server to the client. Because this packet type is used in the process of communication with the server, pack_refresh() is the first thing you should implement. If this function does not work correctly, you will not receive any messages.\n</packet_refresh>\n<packet_formats>\n\n4. Using the Client\n\nWhen you start the chat client, you will be presented with a full-screen terminal application having a box at the bottom for user input. The chat client frequently calls pack_refresh() to send a REFRESH packet to the server to fetch incoming messages. Those incoming messages will be passed to unpack() to be displayed by your client. It will also accept user input and send that input to pack() when the user presses the Enter key. To exit the chat client, press Control-C.\n\n5. Guidance and hints\n\nWhen considering how you are going to implement this assignment, we highly recommend reading over Chapter 5 of K&R. You will also want to read the string [3] man page, which contains a description of all functions defined in string.h.\nYou will almost certainly find it helpful to draw out a few encoded packets of each type, with the appropriate values and padding in the appropriate places, and think about how you will implement code to produce that output. Consider what input the user would type to produce the packet.\n",

Every other node u \\in V is a router. C is the set of clients and C \\subseteq V \\setminus \\{i\\}.\n\nClients vs. Routers\nFor this project, clients can still route packets but routers cannot be clients.\n\nEvery client node in C requests a packet of data from the content provider node i \\in V. The packet addressed to a client c \\in C is denoted by \\text{pkt}_c.\n\nPackets are different\nThe packets \\text{pkt}_c for different clients c are different. I.e. you cannot combine packets for different clients together.\n\n One packet per client\nWe made the simplifying assumption that there is only one packet per client c. Unlike some of the other simplifications we make in this project, this is not such a big simplification.\n\nFor each of the problems 1-5 (see below), you will need to come up with an algorithm that outputs a path to route packets from the content provider node i \\in V to every client in C with some given constraints.\n Routing is centralized\nIn this project, there is a central algorithm that chooses an i-c path for each client c. This is not how routing happens on the Internet. In particular, the TCP/IP  protocol is a distributed protocol. However, distributed algorithms are out of the scope of this course.\n\nEvery problem will have an objective that you need to optimize.\n\nLet P'_c be the actual i-c path determined by your algorithm for client c. We use D(P'_c) to denote the routing delay, which is the delay incurred by the routing algorithm (see below for more details on routing) when it routes all packes along P'_c for all clients c\\in C. Note that this is not necessarily the same as d(P'_c).\n\nEvery node u\\in V has a bandwidth b_u, a bound on the number of packets it can send in each time step.\n\n No bound on incoming traffic\nNote that we are not putting any restriction on how many packets a router can receive in each time step. We make this simplification so that the problems are a bit simpler.\n\nWe will assume that the bandwidth of the ISP node is very large. That is, b_i is a very large value\n</overview>\nproject_info:\ndirectory_structure:\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 ub\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 cse\n\u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 algo\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 util\n|                   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Pair.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Driver.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Globals.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Graph.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Info.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 MPUtility.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Objects.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Revenue.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Simulator.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Solution.java\n\u2502               \u251c\u2500\u2500 Traversals.java\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testcases/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 input1.txt\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 input1.txt-info\n\ncode_base_description:\nYou are given eleven coding files: Pair.java, Driver.java, Globals.java, Graph.java, Info.java, MPUtility.java,Objects.java, Revenue.java, Simulator.java, Solution.java, and Traversals.java.\n\nDriver.java implicitly calls methods in MPUtility.java.

And Graph.java is the Graph represented as an adjacency list (HashMap<Integer,ArrayList<Integer>>).\n\nPlease make sure that you take a good look at Info.java, as it has 11 member variables:\n\nGraph graph: is the input graph which also includes the ISP\nArrayList<Client> clients: is the list of Client objects for all client nodes c \\in C.\nArrayList<Integer> bandwidths: is a mapping between node id's and their corresponding bandwidths. That is, the value of an index, represents the bandwidth of a node whose id is same as the index. Essentially, this is a mapping between each node u \\in V and b_{u}.\nHashMap<Integer, Integer> shortestDelays: is a mapping between client id's and the shortest possible delays to the ISP. (This is only used by the grader and can be safely ignored.)\nSolutionObject solutionObject: the SolutionObject object that will contain your solution returned from outputPaths() (see below for more).\nfloat rho1 same as \\rho_{\\text{lawsuit}}\nfloat rho2 same as \\rho_{\\text{fcc}}\nfloat lawsuit: same as A.\nfloat fccFine: same as B.\nfloat costBandwidth: same as Z.\nYour code will return a SolutionObject (defined in Objects.java), which contains a HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> of paths (make sure your paths start from the content provider); a HashMap<Integer, Integer>, holding your priorities for each client and an ArrayList<Integer> holding your bandwidths after they have been increased.\n\nFinally, the Solution class has four instance variables:\n\ninfo which is an instance of Info class, and encapsulates all the data read from the input files.\ngraph which is an instance of the Graph class the represents the network (note that information is also part of info and it copied over for your convenience)\nclients which is a list of Client objects (note that information is also part of info and it copied over for your convenience)\nbandwidths which is a mapping of ids to node bandwidths (note that information is also part of info and it copied over for your convenience)\n\n<problem>\nSo for this problem, the bandwidth for each router will be limited.\n\n Capturing bandwidth by a single number\nAs mentioned above there are many factors that determine the bandwidth for a client. In this project, we will capture this by a single number, i.e. the value b_u for all u\\in V.\n\nAlso, to be more realistic, the tolerance threshold for any client need not be 1, since different people have varying levels of patience.\n\n Perfect knowledge of \\alpha_c\nIn this project we will assume the prefect knowledge of \\alpha_c (as well as the related quantity \\beta_c that we will introduce in Problem 3), which is not possible in real life. We made this simplifying assumption to model the case that in real-life companies have data about their customers, which they can use to glean various information about them.\n\nThe allegation also says that Spectrum failed to make some necessary adjustments in its network that was necessary for it to deliver the promised internet speeds to its customers. Thus, the i-c paths for all c \\in C that your algorithm generates could also determine how many of ForProfitOnly's clients are satisfied with its services\n</problem>",

                "content": "The scene marks a major turning point in the film. Directly preceding this scene, the bar owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart) refuses to give or sell letters of transit to the war hero/revolutionary Victor Laszlo (Paul Heinreid). The letters of transit are the only hope of freedom for Victor, and his only chance at returning to his efforts at insurgency against the Nazis; Rick knows this, but is still too hurt and bitter that his lost love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has chosen Victor over him. Rick\u2019s refusal is essentially a Nazi victory, despite his careful attempts at framing his (in)actions as simple neutrality. The Germans, led by Major Strausser (Conrad Veidt), have established a de facto control over Casablanca, acting through the openly self-interested French Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains).\n\nAfter \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d everything changes. The uneasy stalemate between Victor Laszlo and Major Strausser can no longer continue in the face of such open defiance of German power. Strausser orders Renault to find a pretense to shut down Rick\u2019s \u2014 leading to arguably the film\u2019s best exchange of dialogue. Strausser uses Ilsa to increase the pressure on Victor. Everything kicks into gear, as now Rick, Ilsa, Victor, and Louis are all forced into unpleasant decisions that will push the film toward its climax.\n\nAnd it all begins with the anthems. As Rick and Victor are ending their disagreement, they hear the German soldiers in the bar below, joyfully and triumphantly singing \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d The rest of the bar is made up largely of refugees from the German war machine, so the anthem feels almost like taunting, a callous display of German power over people seeking to escape their conquering. Even the ever-compliant Louis looks on at the singing with an expression that could be construed as disapproval, before glancing toward Rick to see what he\u2019ll do. (Rick is a constant source of curiosity for Louis throughout the film.) This expression is the first and barest foreshadowing we receive of Louis\u2019s eventual turn.\n\nVictor spends only seconds taking in the scene in front of him before marching straight down to the bar\u2019s band. As he passes, we see Ilsa watch him go by with a look of only partially contained dread. She knows this man and exactly what he\u2019s about to do.\n\nVictor reaches the band and immediately demands that they play \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the French national anthem. Here we see, for the first and perhaps only time, what has made Victor such an important figure. There\u2019s such a fierceness to him, an intensity that comes bursting out as he repeats his demand \u2014 \u201cPlay it\u201d \u2014 less than second after first making it.\n\nThe band leader looks first to Rick for approval; the film had already established previously the absolute loyalty that Rick receives from his employees, in a scene where the bartender cuts off a patron on Rick\u2019s orders despite protests for one more drink. Nothing that follows can happen without Rick\u2019s assent. Bogart\u2019s nod is such a small gesture, but carries such enormous weight. This is the first moment of Rick choosing a side, of joining in resistance in some small way.\n\nThe band launches into \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d with Victor leading the singing, and within two seconds, the entire bar (except the Germans) has stood and joined him. Everyone was ready and waiting for this to happen, even if they didn\u2019t know it: the kindling was already there, and Victor was the spark to light it. Major Strausser makes one attempt to rouse his soldiers into louder voices, but it\u2019s no use. The Germans are but one small enclave, finding themselves within a community that\u2019s filled with less traditional power but greater numbers and far superior zeal. Within moments, \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d has drowned out \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d\n\nStrausser is forced to give up and sit down in anger. That moment is also an example of one of the fascinating things about this scene, and why I\u2019ve rewatched it by itself so many times. While the main focus in on just a small handful of characters, there are numerous people around the edges of shots whose actions and expressions add greatly to the emotions being played out. Take, for instance, the German officer to Strausser\u2019s right (screen left), and the frustration and disgust on his face as he finally gives up the song.\n\nNow, only \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is playing, as the voices rise to a swell. And we come to the heart of the entire scene: Yvonne. The story of Yvonne (Madeleine Lebeau) in Casablanca is perhaps the greatest example of economy in storytelling that I\u2019ve seen. She appears in only three scenes in the entire film, with this one the last of them. Her total screen time combined is probably no more than a minute. And yet, in those brief stretches, we see an entire character arc play out; and what\u2019s more, an arc that acts as a microcosm of the entire film.\n\nWe first see Yvonne early in the film, as she\u2019s upset and confronting Rick because he\u2019s rebuffed her after the two of them apparently shared a one-night stand. She tries to get drunker, but Rick takes that away from her too and has her sent home. The next time she appears, she\u2019s at the bar and romantically entwined with a German soldier. A Frenchman takes exception to that pairing and starts a fight; Yvonne sides with the German. These two scenes, as brief as they are, tell us so much about her. She\u2019s a broken woman, desperately seeking a man, possibly for love but more likely for a sense of protection and comfort in dangerous times. This desperation leads her all the way to the point of willingly collaborating and romantically pairing with a German.\n\nBut then, there\u2019s \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d A sudden and fervent outburst of patriotism that spreads like wildfire through the bar, overwhelming the Germans and awakening a passion in its singers. As the song begins to near its climax, we get a close-up of Yvonne, singing along with a very different kind of passion. We see tears streaking down her face and a pained expression as she sings. In just these few seconds, you can see a mountain of development and emotion. The same woman who was willing to compromise everything for her own security is realizing how far that compromise has made her fall; is realizing that she may never see the homeland she loves again; is realizing that she\u2019d rather die a true Frenchwoman than live a traitor. It\u2019s the same type of journey we see Rick travel more slowly throughout the movie, and shows perhaps the film\u2019s most important motif: the choice between personal desire or safety and the greater good. How many people must have faced similar choices in the war \u2014 to collaborate or die? Yvonne isn\u2019t just herself in this scene; she\u2019s representing scores of people as she faces hard truths and makes her emotional break.\n\nWe then move to Ilsa, and without a word, she conveys everything we need to know about her relationship with Victor. The movie wouldn\u2019t be nearly as enduring without Bergman\u2019s flawless portrayal of Ilsa. It\u2019s easy to imagine a version of the film with Ilsa coming across as just a reductive caricature; her role in the plot revolves mostly around her being torn between two men whom she both loves. But Bergman imbues her with such subtle strength that Ilsa always feels like she has agency. Even when she tells Rick near the end that he must make the choices for both of them, it feels like a lie; she believes Rick will choose to keep her and him together, so telling him to make the choice is itself the choice.\n\nBut while Casablanca gives us flashbacks to Ilsa and Rick\u2019s time together in Paris, the development of Ilsa and Victor is mostly expository. This scene is perhaps the best representation of how they fit together. Victor charged past Ilsa without a word, and we already saw the dread in her face as she knew what he was about to do. Now we get the first shot of her reaction to \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d after it\u2019s begun. You can see it on her face and in the deep breaths she takes: she knows. She knows what this means for Victor, for his cause, for her, for their relationship. His open defiance in the face of the German soldiers will end all good hope they had of ever leaving Casablanca alive and together. You can see her heart breaking as she recognizes their predicament before anyone else in the room has even considered it.\n\nBut then the camera cuts back to Victor, still singing triumphantly. There is such bravado in Henreid\u2019s performance here; it\u2019s the one scene where you can really see Victor as a revolutionary leader, capable of inspiring people into acts of defiance in the face of tyranny. When the camera reaches Ilsa again, her expression has softened, melted even, into one of love. A bittersweet love, perhaps, but an evident one. She knows that this reckless disregard for his own life is that same thing that once landed Victor in a concentration camp and threatens him again now in Casablanca, but that zeal must be the same reason she fell for him in the first place. Again, the economy of storytelling here is remarkable. Within a handful of seconds, an entire wordless story has been told: Ilsa\u2019s sad resignation to their changing circumstances, Victor\u2019s passionate defiance, and Ilsa\u2019s acceptance of her husband, loving him for the fact that his greatest flaws are also his greatest virtues.\n\nIlsa\u2019s acceptance is the final act needed for \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d to move on to reach its climax. Within less than just a couple of minutes, we have had the German aggression, Victor\u2019s rebellion against it, Rick taking his first stand, the overwhelming passion of the French crowd, the redemption of Yvonne painting a story representative of the whole film, and Ilsa and Victor\u2019s unconventional love in the face of adversity. All that remains is the final groundswell.\n\nThe power of this scene is helped, of course, by the indisputable fact that \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is an incredible national anthem. While I\u2019m by no means an expert, it\u2019s the best one I\u2019ve ever heard from any country, and its association in my mind with this scene is highly likely to always keep it there. But the scene is also helped by the people in it. The main actors are at their finest here, and I already mentioned how supporting actors gave great little tidbits in the German soldier part.\n\nYet perhaps the greatest thing in this scene is that most of the people in it weren\u2019t actors at all; rather, director Michael Curtiz filled the scene with actual French refugees. Keep in mind, this movie came out in 1942 and was filmed at the height of World War II, at a time when Germany looked nearly unbeatable and Nazi occupation of France was indefinite. And here was a group of refugees from that occupation, given the chance to sing their anthem with defiant pride. For one brief moment, this wasn\u2019t a movie. It was real life, and it was tragic, and it was brave. Reports have said that extras were crying on set during filming, and the passion is evident any time you look past the main actors to the background singers. Note, for instance, the furious arm pump by the man in the background behind the blonde woman at the left of the screen:\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the film is entirely in English; \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is the only foreign language sequence I can recall, and it\u2019s presented without subtitles. (You can find the English translation here; it\u2019s very much a true battle song, in the goriest sense of the phrase.)  For some reason, that adds even more to its power for me. It\u2019s unapologetically French, and derives much of its power from that. It was their anthem, at the time they needed it most. And for the film\u2019s audience, most of whom were probably not speaking French, the intentional creation of a brief language barrier allows for a pure distillation of the passion of the singing; it\u2019s not the words that matter, it\u2019s what they represent to the people saying them. And what they represent is an ability to stand up in their darkest hour and show their oppressors that their pride will never be extinguished.\n\nThe song ends with one final shot of Yvonne, the final time we see her in the film. With wet cheeks, she yells \u201cVive la France!\u201d\n\nI truly believe this remains the greatest scene ever filmed. It\u2019s filled with such raw power and emotion, showing a beacon of light in the midst of some of humanity\u2019s darkest days. It tells so much of a story in such a brief moment, distilling numerous characters down to their cores and giving them developments and arcs through the merest of glances. It\u2019s the turning point that pushes the plot and its characters to the point of no return, where a final and deadly confrontation will become necessary. All because of the power of a single song, and its ability to inspire, to create and destroy, to stoke passions and reconciliations and fears and loves. All because of \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d",

                "content": "narrative - An adjective describing a film as being primarily a\nwork of fiction, or a noun that loosely means a fictional story.\ndocumentary - Also an adjective or noun category used to\ndescribe a work of nonfiction.\nplot - refers to all aspects of the narrative that we see on screen.\nFor example, in the film Jaws, Chief Brody\u2019s talking to the town\ncouncil on screen would be part of the plot.\nstory - refers to all aspects of the narrative that we do not see on\nscreen; these aspects may include events before, during, or even\nafter the plot of the film. In Jaws, for instance, Chief Brody had\nbeen a police officer in the city prior to the film\u2019s beginning; this\ninformation is part of the story but not part of the plot.\ndiegesis - refers to the narrative that we see on screen. This term is\nmuch more specific to film, however, and refers to the world that\nthe characters inhabit as much as the plot of the film. The\nadjective diegetic, for instance, refers to something the characters\nin the film could perceive, whereas nondiegetic refers to something\nthey could not (see diegetic and nondiegetic sound below).\npoint of view - Most people assume film always has a third-person\nperspective, but even when it does not use a POV shot (see below),\nfilm often has a more subjective perspective through the use of\ncamera placement, voiceover, and other cinema techniques.\nmise-en-sc\u00e8ne - refers to everything in the frame of the film, which\nwould include lighting, set, props, and the staging and movement\nof actors. The term derives from the theater, where it is used in a\nsimilar way. In the 1950s, a group of French critics at the journal\nCahiers du Cin\u00e9ma used this term in a different way. For them,\nmise-en-sc\u00e8ne meant a special aspect of cinema associated with\ncertain directors. Eventually, you will want to understand both\nmeanings of the term, since this secondary meaning is closely\nconnected to the idea of auteurism in cinema.. Initially, however,\nuse mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in the first sense.\nsetting - like the literary term, this word refers to the time and\nplace of the film. The setting for The Usual Suspects, for instance,\nis New York and Los Angeles at a time contemporary with the\nfilm\u2019s year of release (in this case, 1995).\nset - This term refers to the actual construction in which the actors\nare filmed. In The Usual Suspects, for instance, a set might be the\ninterrogation room in the film. Sets are usually built for a film, as\nopposed to shooting on location, where a scene is shot in the actual\nplace in which it occurs in the film. If a film crew shot on location\nin Venice, Italy, for instance, they might actually be shooting the\nscene in gondolas on the canals. Set is also used generally,\nhowever, as a designation for the place where a film is being shot.\n(So even in location shooting, the director would be \u201con the set\u201d of\nhis or her film every time he or she went to the place where the\ncrew was shooting for that day.)\nprop - another term borrowed from theater. A prop is generally \nany object on a set, though clearly the objects that characters will\ntouch become more important. A trumpet, for instance, might be\npart of the backdrop in a music store scene, but if a character is\ngoing to play the trumpet, the prop takes on more importance.\ncostumes - what the characters are wearing. Bear in mind that\neven if a character is wearing contemporary clothing (in some\ncases, the actors\u2019 own clothing), that clothing is still considered a\ncostume.\nlighting - This term refers to the way in which lights are used for a\ngiven film. Lighting, in conjunction with the camera, sets the\nvisual look for a film. The key light is the main light used for a\nscene; back light refers to a secondary source, usually placed\nbehind the actors; and fill refers to a light placed to the side of the\nactors. This system is called three-point lighting and was very\ncommon in classical Hollywood films. You may also run across\nthe term low-key lighting, which means that the film was shot\noften using only the key light at a very low setting. This low level\nof lighting creates dark shadows on the faces of actors and is\nparticularly moody when used with black-and-white film. It is\nmost often associated with film noir but is not exclusive to that\ngenre.\nshot (and close-up v. long shot) - generally, the smallest unit of\nunbroken film. The camera can move within a shot, but the second\nthat the film makes a transition (see below) to another shot, the\nprevious shot has ended. Alternatively, when used with certain\nadjectives, shot also refers to the distance from the camera to the\nsubject, almost always the actor. In a long shot (or a wide shot),\none can see the entire body of the actor; in a medium shot, one\ncan see the actor from the waist up; in a close-up, one can see only\nthe actor\u2019s face (there is no such term as the \u201cshort shot\u201d). You\nmight also see an extreme close-up in a film, where you can only\nsee part of the actor\u2019s face (just the eyes, for example). Also, \nanother common term is the two-shot, which is generally a\nmedium to medium-long shot of two actors; two-shots were very\ncommon in the classical Hollywood era and continue to be used\ntoday.\npan - the movement of a stationary camera on a horizontal axis. A\ncamera on a tripod that moves from left to right (following a\nparade, for instance), would be panning.\ntilt - the movement of a stationary camera on a vertical axis. A\ncamera on a tripod that moves up and down (following a plane\nlanding, for instance), would be performing a tilt.\ntracking shot - the movement of the shot when the camera is no\nlonger stationary. The term refers to the tracks that cameras were\nonce rolled on when creating one of these shots. Although tracks\nare still often used with a tracking shot, the term might also refer\nmore generally to a moving shot that appears stable, such as a\nsteadicam shot, which uses a gyroscope to avoid the shaky effects\nassociated with hand-held shots. You may also run across the term\ndolly shot, which refers to what the camera rests on (a platform\nwith wheels) while the camera moves in certain kinds of shots.\nDolly shot is sometimes used interchangeably with tracking shot,\nsince dollies very often use tracks.\nhandheld shot - refers to a shot where the camera is held by the\ncamera operator. Hand-held shots are often associated with a\ncertain look, which is shaky, and most people associate the handheld shot with a kind of documentary realism. Narrative films and\ntelevision often use the hand-held for this reason, as they are able\nto create a sense of gritty realism. The television show Law and\nOrder, for instance, often uses hand-held shots when the detectives\nare questioning suspects on the streets, giving the viewer the sense\nthat the scene is more real. Bear in mind, however, that no one\ntechnique ever has the same meaning in every film (a handheld \nshot might be used to decrease the sense of realism).\ncrane shot - A shot taken from a crane. You often see these shots\nat the beginning of a scene (using it as an establishing shot) or the\nend of a scene. The end of a movie, in fact, often uses a crane shot\n(though sometimes is even more extreme).\nPOV shot - stands for \u201cPoint of View\u201d shot. This type of shot\ndoes not refer to the technology used so much as the way we\ninterpret it. In this kind of shot, we are looking through the eyes of\na character; you have probably seen a POV shot when a character\nwho has been rendered unconscious is waking (the other characters\nlook directly into the camera, in a low-angle shot (see below), and\nsay \u201cAre you okay?\u201d as the edges of the frame are blurred and the\nspeech has an echo effect).\nhigh-angle shot, low-angle shot - These terms refer to camera\nplacement. If a camera is looking down on an actor from a high\nvantage, it is a high-angle shot; if a camera is placed very low to\nthe ground and looks \u201cup\u201d at actors, it is a low-angle shot. Highangle shots might emphasize that characters are being\noverwhelmed by their circumstances, while low-angle shots might\nemphasize that characters are somehow larger than life. Be very\ncareful, however, when attaching a certain cinema technique to a\nrecurring plot device or tone. There are always exceptions, and\nyou need to evaluate every scene individually.\ntake (and short v. long take) - generally, a take refers to the time a\nshot is begun to the time it stops. On a film set, a director might\nhave to go through several takes before settling on the shot he or\nshe wants (you have probably seen this in films before, with the\nclapboard and someone shouting \u201cTake 12\u201d--meaning they have\ndone this shot eleven times before this one). Alternatively, like\nshot, take also takes on a secondary meaning when combined with\ncertain adjectives (in this case, long and short), except that a long \nor short take refers to time, whereas a long shot or close-up refers\nto distance. A short take, for instance, might be one or two\nseconds long, although contemporary films continue to use shorter\nand shorter takes of less than a single second (making two or three\nseconds, which sounds like a short amount of time, not very short\nat all). A long take would refer to a single unbroken shot that lasts\nfor a larger amount of time--thirty seconds, for instance. One\nextreme recent example of a long take would be Russian Ark, a\nfilm shot on digital video and using a single, very long take for the\nentire film. Another more extreme example would be Alfred\nHitchcock\u2019s Rope, where the director used long takes of several\nminutes apiece and attempted to hide the cuts by tracking behind\ncharacters\u2019 backs or pieces of furniture. Some directors are also\nfamous for the use of long takes, such as Jean Renoir and Orson\nWelles.\nframe \u2013 Literally, a frame of film refers to the smallest unit of film\npossible. Film frames appear on a film strip, which, when\nprojected, creates the illusion of motion. Film is shown at 24\nframes per second (or f.p.s., a common abbreviation). In a much\nlooser sense, scholars sometimes talk about the frame to mean the\nfour sides of the film as it is being projected, and they also often\nuse it as a verb (e.g. \u201cThe film frames the action in such a way that\nwe can see both characters at once.\u201d)\nscreen - often used with on or off to refer to what we see within\nthe frame. On-screen action, for instance, is something we can see,\nwhereas off-screen action might be something we hear but which\ntakes place outside the frame. Screen also refers to the actual\nphysical screen on which we project a film.\nshallow/soft focus - refers to how much of the shot is in focus.\nWith shallow or soft focus, generally we can only see the actor\u2019s\nface in focus. The background appears blurry. This kind of focus\nwas common in Classic Hollywood and is still common, because if \nthe viewer cannot see the background, then the director does not\nneed to light the background, for instance, or make sure the\nbackground is perfectly ordered. Also, a blurry background\nfocuses our attention all the more on what is in focus, which is\ngenerally the actor\u2019s face. Shallow focus is achieved with a long\nlens (this can be confusing, since one would assume a shallow\nfocus would require a short lens).\ndeep focus - refers to a shot in which everything, including the\nbackground, is in focus. This type of shot is much more difficult\nto achieve, since the entire set must be adequately lit, designed,\netc. Also, the danger is that the viewer\u2019s attention will shift from\nsubject to backdrop, but some directors use this \u201cdanger\u201d to their\nadvantage. William Wyler, for instance, in The Best Years of Our\nLives, shows a man playing a piano in the foreground while\nanother man in the background calls his girlfriend (the first man\u2019s\ndaughter) to break things off. Without deep focus, this shot would\nbe impossible. Directors Jean Renoir and Orson Welles are most\noften associated with deep focus, which sometimes (but does not\nalways) accompany long takes and a moving camera (since\neverything is lit, the camera is much more able to move fluidly and\nreposition itself among actors and props).\nrack focus - Shifting the focus from one object to another within a\nsingle shot. Sometimes, directors will use a rack focus when two\ncharacters are on screen at once but are positioned at different\ndistances from the camera.\nediting - refers to the way that individual shots are connected to\none another to make the film.\nmontage - this word has two meanings. First, montage can\nsimply be another word for editing, which is often the way you\nwill see it in film theory or when we study the Soviet filmmakers\nof the early twentieth century. Second, and more commonly in \ncontemporary usage, montage refers to a series of shots edited\ntogether to show a longer activity evolving in a shorter amount of\ntime or to show a series of related activities. A sports film, for\ninstance, might have a training montage, where the character\nbecomes much better at the sport (the film might condense three\nmonths of training, for instance, into a two-minute montage of\njogging, lifting weights, etc.). Or a film might show a series of\nrelated activities through montage. For instance, a film about a\nnews station might have a montage of the evening news preparing\nto air (with shots of make-up being applied to the anchors\u2019 faces,\ncameras being moved into position, producers arguing over a story,\nand other images and sounds we might associate with this scene).\ntransition - refers to the way a shot moves from one to the next.\nFilms use several different kinds of transitions, including:\n\u2022 cut - simply splicing one shot to the next. The most common\nkind of transitions, cuts are used extensively in editing.\n\u2022 dissolve - when one shot \u201cbleeds\u201d into another. In other words,\nthe end of the first shot is still visible as the second shot\nbecomes visible. Dissolves are often (but not always) used to\nshow a smaller amount of time passing than a fade in or fade\nout.\n\u2022 fade in, fade out - Going from black (nothing on the screen) to a\nshot (fade in), or going from a shot to black (fade out). These\ntransitions usually (but not always) connote a larger amount\nof time passing or might also be used to signal a break in the\nnarrative (the end of an act, for instance).\n\u2022 wipe - one shot \u201cwipes\u201d across the screen and replaces another.\nYou do not see wipes used overly often in contemporary\nfilms, although some directors use them often (the Star Wars\nfilms use wipes consistently).\n\u2022 iris-in, iris-out - this transition almost never appears in\ncontemporary films and was used much more commonly in\nearly cinema. Here, the shot goes from a full frame to\nfocusing a small circle around a certain part of the shot, with\neverything else blacked out (the iris-in), or the reverse occurs\n(the iris-out). You may have seen this transition at the end of\na Looney Tunes cartoon, when the cartoon character will\nsometimes poke his or her head out of the iris as it closes in\nand crack one last joke (e.g when Porky Pig says, \u201cTha-thatha, that\u2019s all folks\u201d).\nscene - a series of shots that form a cohesive unit of narrative. For\ninstance, in Rear Window, we might discuss the scene where Grace\nKelly kids Jimmy Stewart about not marrying her yet. Films have\nboth acts and scenes, like theater, although they are often less\nobvious because there are rarely intermissions or accompanying\nprograms in film. Screenwriters typically use acts when writing a\nfilm. Scholars, however, almost never discuss an act of a film,\nwhereas scene is used extensively.\ncontinuity editing - also called invisible editing or Classic\nHollywood editing. This system of editing is the system that\nClassic Hollywood established (though it had been in use before\nthat period) and is essentially the system that exists today.\nUnderstanding this system is crucial to understanding cinema,\nsince even those directors who break with this system are in a\nsense defining themselves against it. This system is associated\nwith the following other terms:\n\u2022 establishing shot - This term has two meanings. In one context,\nestablishing shot refers to the shot at a beginning of a film or\nscene that established location. For instance, if the setting of\na film is 1940s Occupied France, the film might open with a\nshot of the Eiffel Tower with two Gestapo soldiers in the \nforeground. This shot establishes place (and sometimes, as in\nthis example, time). Establishing shot is also used in\ncontinuity editing to describe a shot that establishes the\nspatial relationships in a given scene.\n\u2022 shot/reverse shot - After an establishing shot, the shot-reverse\nshot refers to the close-ups used when two characters are in\nconversation. (Because we have already used an establishing\nshot, we now know where the characters are in relation to\none another.)\n\u2022 match-on-action - connects two shots cut together by having a\ncharacter finish an action in the second shot begun in the first\nshot. For instance, if a character lights a match in the first\nshot, the same character will draw it up to a cigarette in the\nsecond.\n\u2022 eyeline match - The directions that actors look affect the way we\nperceive their spatial relationships to one another. Eyeline\nmatches are important for establishing who a character is\ntalking to or what a character is looking at. For instance, if a\ncharacter is talking to two people on either side of him or her,\nthen the character will look to the left of the camera to\nconnote that he or she is talking to the person in that\ndirection.\n\u2022 the 180-degree rule - This term refers to the rule that once a\nspatial relationship has been confirmed with the establishing\nshot, no close-up will cross the imaginary line drawn\nbetween those two actors until a new line (or axis) has been\nestablished, usually through another establishing shot.\nzoom-in, zoom-out - using certain lenses, the camera can move\nmore closely into a subject (the zoom-in) or pull back (the zoomout). The zoom-in is sometimes called a push-in, and the zoom-\nout is sometimes called the pull-back.\nsound - everything we hear from the audio track of the film.\nmusic - any music that comes from the audio track. Music might\nbe diegetic (a song on the radio of a car a character is driving) or\nnondiegetic (scary music when a villain appears on screen).\ndiegetic sound - sound that other characters would be able to\nhear. A song on a radio, for instance, as a character drives down\nthe highway, would be a diegetic sound, as would someone\ncoughing audibly during a scene. It is important to note that\ndiegetic sound is a sound that characters could hear, even if they\nare not present when that sound occurs. The sound of a radio\nplaying in an apartment, for instance, is a diegetic sound, even if\nno character is present in the apartment during the scene.\nnondiegetic sound - sound that characters cannot hear. The two\nmost common types of nondiegetic sound are voiceovers, which is\na character\u2019s narration that plays over any given scene, and\nnondiegetic music, which is music used to inflect the mood of a\ngiven scene. Creepy horror-movie music, for instance, that plays\nwhen a character is walking into an old house, is nondiegetic\nmusic, since that character cannot hear the music. Sometimes, this\neffect is parodied (with characters commenting on the scary music\nplaying), and some directors will transition from a nondiegetic\nsound to a diegetic sound (or vice-versa), as when a song is\nplaying on a radio that then becomes the nondiegetic music even as\nthe characters move into a new scene without the radio in it.\nambient sound - This term generally refers to any sounds that are\nused to establish location. The ambient sound of a scene in a park,\nfor instance, might include birds chirping, children laughing, or a\ndog barking. The ambient sound of a train station would include\nthe whine of train brakes, the tinny sounds of arrival and departure ",

                "content": "The scene marks a major turning point in the film. Directly preceding this scene, the bar owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart) refuses to give or sell letters of transit to the war hero/revolutionary Victor Laszlo (Paul Heinreid). The letters of transit are the only hope of freedom for Victor, and his only chance at returning to his efforts at insurgency against the Nazis; Rick knows this, but is still too hurt and bitter that his lost love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has chosen Victor over him. Rick\u2019s refusal is essentially a Nazi victory, despite his careful attempts at framing his (in)actions as simple neutrality. The Germans, led by Major Strausser (Conrad Veidt), have established a de facto control over Casablanca, acting through the openly self-interested French Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains).\n\nAfter \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d everything changes. The uneasy stalemate between Victor Laszlo and Major Strausser can no longer continue in the face of such open defiance of German power. Strausser orders Renault to find a pretense to shut down Rick\u2019s \u2014 leading to arguably the film\u2019s best exchange of dialogue. Strausser uses Ilsa to increase the pressure on Victor. Everything kicks into gear, as now Rick, Ilsa, Victor, and Louis are all forced into unpleasant decisions that will push the film toward its climax.\n\nAnd it all begins with the anthems. As Rick and Victor are ending their disagreement, they hear the German soldiers in the bar below, joyfully and triumphantly singing \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d The rest of the bar is made up largely of refugees from the German war machine, so the anthem feels almost like taunting, a callous display of German power over people seeking to escape their conquering. Even the ever-compliant Louis looks on at the singing with an expression that could be construed as disapproval, before glancing toward Rick to see what he\u2019ll do. (Rick is a constant source of curiosity for Louis throughout the film.) This expression is the first and barest foreshadowing we receive of Louis\u2019s eventual turn.\n\nVictor spends only seconds taking in the scene in front of him before marching straight down to the bar\u2019s band. As he passes, we see Ilsa watch him go by with a look of only partially contained dread. She knows this man and exactly what he\u2019s about to do.\n\nVictor reaches the band and immediately demands that they play \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the French national anthem. Here we see, for the first and perhaps only time, what has made Victor such an important figure. There\u2019s such a fierceness to him, an intensity that comes bursting out as he repeats his demand \u2014 \u201cPlay it\u201d \u2014 less than second after first making it.\n\nThe band leader looks first to Rick for approval; the film had already established previously the absolute loyalty that Rick receives from his employees, in a scene where the bartender cuts off a patron on Rick\u2019s orders despite protests for one more drink. Nothing that follows can happen without Rick\u2019s assent. Bogart\u2019s nod is such a small gesture, but carries such enormous weight. This is the first moment of Rick choosing a side, of joining in resistance in some small way.\n\nThe band launches into \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d with Victor leading the singing, and within two seconds, the entire bar (except the Germans) has stood and joined him. Everyone was ready and waiting for this to happen, even if they didn\u2019t know it: the kindling was already there, and Victor was the spark to light it. Major Strausser makes one attempt to rouse his soldiers into louder voices, but it\u2019s no use. The Germans are but one small enclave, finding themselves within a community that\u2019s filled with less traditional power but greater numbers and far superior zeal. Within moments, \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d has drowned out \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d\n\nStrausser is forced to give up and sit down in anger. That moment is also an example of one of the fascinating things about this scene, and why I\u2019ve rewatched it by itself so many times. While the main focus in on just a small handful of characters, there are numerous people around the edges of shots whose actions and expressions add greatly to the emotions being played out. Take, for instance, the German officer to Strausser\u2019s right (screen left), and the frustration and disgust on his face as he finally gives up the song.\n\nNow, only \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is playing, as the voices rise to a swell. And we come to the heart of the entire scene: Yvonne. The story of Yvonne (Madeleine Lebeau) in Casablanca is perhaps the greatest example of economy in storytelling that I\u2019ve seen. She appears in only three scenes in the entire film, with this one the last of them. Her total screen time combined is probably no more than a minute. And yet, in those brief stretches, we see an entire character arc play out; and what\u2019s more, an arc that acts as a microcosm of the entire film.\n\nWe first see Yvonne early in the film, as she\u2019s upset and confronting Rick because he\u2019s rebuffed her after the two of them apparently shared a one-night stand. She tries to get drunker, but Rick takes that away from her too and has her sent home. The next time she appears, she\u2019s at the bar and romantically entwined with a German soldier. A Frenchman takes exception to that pairing and starts a fight; Yvonne sides with the German. These two scenes, as brief as they are, tell us so much about her. She\u2019s a broken woman, desperately seeking a man, possibly for love but more likely for a sense of protection and comfort in dangerous times. This desperation leads her all the way to the point of willingly collaborating and romantically pairing with a German.\n\nBut then, there\u2019s \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d A sudden and fervent outburst of patriotism that spreads like wildfire through the bar, overwhelming the Germans and awakening a passion in its singers. As the song begins to near its climax, we get a close-up of Yvonne, singing along with a very different kind of passion. We see tears streaking down her face and a pained expression as she sings. In just these few seconds, you can see a mountain of development and emotion. The same woman who was willing to compromise everything for her own security is realizing how far that compromise has made her fall; is realizing that she may never see the homeland she loves again; is realizing that she\u2019d rather die a true Frenchwoman than live a traitor. It\u2019s the same type of journey we see Rick travel more slowly throughout the movie, and shows perhaps the film\u2019s most important motif: the choice between personal desire or safety and the greater good. How many people must have faced similar choices in the war \u2014 to collaborate or die? Yvonne isn\u2019t just herself in this scene; she\u2019s representing scores of people as she faces hard truths and makes her emotional break.\n\nWe then move to Ilsa, and without a word, she conveys everything we need to know about her relationship with Victor. The movie wouldn\u2019t be nearly as enduring without Bergman\u2019s flawless portrayal of Ilsa. It\u2019s easy to imagine a version of the film with Ilsa coming across as just a reductive caricature; her role in the plot revolves mostly around her being torn between two men whom she both loves. But Bergman imbues her with such subtle strength that Ilsa always feels like she has agency. Even when she tells Rick near the end that he must make the choices for both of them, it feels like a lie; she believes Rick will choose to keep her and him together, so telling him to make the choice is itself the choice.\n\nBut while Casablanca gives us flashbacks to Ilsa and Rick\u2019s time together in Paris, the development of Ilsa and Victor is mostly expository. This scene is perhaps the best representation of how they fit together. Victor charged past Ilsa without a word, and we already saw the dread in her face as she knew what he was about to do. Now we get the first shot of her reaction to \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d after it\u2019s begun. You can see it on her face and in the deep breaths she takes: she knows. She knows what this means for Victor, for his cause, for her, for their relationship. His open defiance in the face of the German soldiers will end all good hope they had of ever leaving Casablanca alive and together. You can see her heart breaking as she recognizes their predicament before anyone else in the room has even considered it.\n\nBut then the camera cuts back to Victor, still singing triumphantly. There is such bravado in Henreid\u2019s performance here; it\u2019s the one scene where you can really see Victor as a revolutionary leader, capable of inspiring people into acts of defiance in the face of tyranny. When the camera reaches Ilsa again, her expression has softened, melted even, into one of love. A bittersweet love, perhaps, but an evident one. She knows that this reckless disregard for his own life is that same thing that once landed Victor in a concentration camp and threatens him again now in Casablanca, but that zeal must be the same reason she fell for him in the first place. Again, the economy of storytelling here is remarkable. Within a handful of seconds, an entire wordless story has been told: Ilsa\u2019s sad resignation to their changing circumstances, Victor\u2019s passionate defiance, and Ilsa\u2019s acceptance of her husband, loving him for the fact that his greatest flaws are also his greatest virtues.\n\nIlsa\u2019s acceptance is the final act needed for \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d to move on to reach its climax. Within less than just a couple of minutes, we have had the German aggression, Victor\u2019s rebellion against it, Rick taking his first stand, the overwhelming passion of the French crowd, the redemption of Yvonne painting a story representative of the whole film, and Ilsa and Victor\u2019s unconventional love in the face of adversity. All that remains is the final groundswell.\n\nThe power of this scene is helped, of course, by the indisputable fact that \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is an incredible national anthem. While I\u2019m by no means an expert, it\u2019s the best one I\u2019ve ever heard from any country, and its association in my mind with this scene is highly likely to always keep it there. But the scene is also helped by the people in it. The main actors are at their finest here, and I already mentioned how supporting actors gave great little tidbits in the German soldier part.\n\nYet perhaps the greatest thing in this scene is that most of the people in it weren\u2019t actors at all; rather, director Michael Curtiz filled the scene with actual French refugees. Keep in mind, this movie came out in 1942 and was filmed at the height of World War II, at a time when Germany looked nearly unbeatable and Nazi occupation of France was indefinite. And here was a group of refugees from that occupation, given the chance to sing their anthem with defiant pride. For one brief moment, this wasn\u2019t a movie. It was real life, and it was tragic, and it was brave. Reports have said that extras were crying on set during filming, and the passion is evident any time you look past the main actors to the background singers. Note, for instance, the furious arm pump by the man in the background behind the blonde woman at the left of the screen:\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the film is entirely in English; \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is the only foreign language sequence I can recall, and it\u2019s presented without subtitles. (You can find the English translation here; it\u2019s very much a true battle song, in the goriest sense of the phrase.)  For some reason, that adds even more to its power for me. It\u2019s unapologetically French, and derives much of its power from that. It was their anthem, at the time they needed it most. And for the film\u2019s audience, most of whom were probably not speaking French, the intentional creation of a brief language barrier allows for a pure distillation of the passion of the singing; it\u2019s not the words that matter, it\u2019s what they represent to the people saying them. And what they represent is an ability to stand up in their darkest hour and show their oppressors that their pride will never be extinguished.\n\nThe song ends with one final shot of Yvonne, the final time we see her in the film. With wet cheeks, she yells \u201cVive la France!\u201d\n\nI truly believe this remains the greatest scene ever filmed. It\u2019s filled with such raw power and emotion, showing a beacon of light in the midst of some of humanity\u2019s darkest days. It tells so much of a story in such a brief moment, distilling numerous characters down to their cores and giving them developments and arcs through the merest of glances. It\u2019s the turning point that pushes the plot and its characters to the point of no return, where a final and deadly confrontation will become necessary. All because of the power of a single song, and its ability to inspire, to create and destroy, to stoke passions and reconciliations and fears and loves. All because of \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d",

                "content": "<one>\nThe scene marks a major turning point in the film. Directly preceding this scene, the bar owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart) refuses to give or sell letters of transit to the war hero/revolutionary Victor Laszlo (Paul Heinreid). The letters of transit are the only hope of freedom for Victor, and his only chance at returning to his efforts at insurgency against the Nazis; Rick knows this, but is still too hurt and bitter that his lost love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has chosen Victor over him. Rick\u2019s refusal is essentially a Nazi victory, despite his careful attempts at framing his (in)actions as simple neutrality. The Germans, led by Major Strausser (Conrad Veidt), have established a de facto control over Casablanca, acting through the openly self-interested French Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains).\n</one>\n<two>\nAfter \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d everything changes. The uneasy stalemate between Victor Laszlo and Major Strausser can no longer continue in the face of such open defiance of German power. Strausser orders Renault to find a pretense to shut down Rick\u2019s \u2014 leading to arguably the film\u2019s best exchange of dialogue. Strausser uses Ilsa to increase the pressure on Victor. Everything kicks into gear, as now Rick, Ilsa, Victor, and Louis are all forced into unpleasant decisions that will push the film toward its climax.\n</two>\n<three>\nAnd it all begins with the anthems. As Rick and Victor are ending their disagreement, they hear the German soldiers in the bar below, joyfully and triumphantly singing \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d The rest of the bar is made up largely of refugees from the German war machine, so the anthem feels almost like taunting, a callous display of German power over people seeking to escape their conquering. Even the ever-compliant Louis looks on at the singing with an expression that could be construed as disapproval, before glancing toward Rick to see what he\u2019ll do. (Rick is a constant source of curiosity for Louis throughout the film.) This expression is the first and barest foreshadowing we receive of Louis\u2019s eventual turn.\n</three>\n<four>\nVictor spends only seconds taking in the scene in front of him before marching straight down to the bar\u2019s band. As he passes, the camera zooms in on Ilsa as she watches him go by with a look of only partially contained dread. She knows this man and exactly what he\u2019s about to do.\n</four>\n<FOUR_shot>\nThe camera work here is particularly notable for its dramatic push-in shot on Ilsa. Starting from a medium shot that captures both her upper body and some surrounding context, the camera slowly but deliberately zooms in to a medium close-up of her face. This gradual push-in emphasizes her growing anxiety and creates a sense of psychological compression as she watches Victor walk past.\n</FOUR_shot>\n<five>\nVictor reaches the band and immediately demands that they play \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the French national anthem. Here we see, for the first and perhaps only time, what has made Victor such an important figure. There\u2019s such a fierceness to him, an intensity that comes bursting out as he repeats his demand \u2014 \u201cPlay it\u201d \u2014 less than second after first making it.\n</five>\n<six>\nThe band leader looks first to Rick for approval; the film had already established previously the absolute loyalty that Rick receives from his employees, in a scene where the bartender cuts off a patron on Rick\u2019s orders despite protests for one more drink. Nothing that follows can happen without Rick\u2019s assent. Bogart\u2019s nod is such a small gesture, but carries such enormous weight. This is the first moment of Rick choosing a side, of joining in resistance in some small way.\n</six>\n<SIX_shot>\nThe scene captures Rick's crucial nod through a tight close-up shot, with the camera positioned slightly below eye level to emphasize his authority. The shot is completely static, which makes the small gesture of his nod more pronounced against the stillness of the frame. The lighting creates a subtle shadow across his eyes, characteristic of film noir style, adding to the weight of his decision.\n</SIX_shot>\n<seven>\nThe band launches into \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d with Victor leading the singing, and within two seconds, the entire bar (except the Germans) has stood and joined him. Everyone was ready and waiting for this to happen, even if they didn\u2019t know it: the kindling was already there, and Victor was the spark to light it. Major Strausser makes one attempt to rouse his soldiers into louder voices, but it\u2019s no use. The Germans are but one small enclave, finding themselves within a community that\u2019s filled with less traditional power but greater numbers and far superior zeal. Within moments, \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d has drowned out \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d\n</seven>\n<SEVEN_shot>\nThe camera work during the competing anthems employs a series of dynamic cuts between wide shots and medium shots. It starts with a wide establishing shot showing the spatial relationship between the German soldiers' table and the rest of the bar. The camera then alternates between medium shots of the German group and panning shots across the other patrons as they join the singing, effectively visualizing the musical battle through spatial composition. The panning movements become more frequent as more people join in \"La Marseillaise,\" creating a visual rhythm that matches the building musical tension.\n</SEVEN_shot>\n<eight>\nStrausser is forced to give up and sit down in anger. That moment is also an example of one of the fascinating things about this scene, and why I\u2019ve rewatched it by itself so many times. While the main focus in on just a small handful of characters, there are numerous people around the edges of shots whose actions and expressions add greatly to the emotions being played out. Take, for instance, the German officer to Strausser\u2019s right (screen left), and the frustration and disgust on his face as he finally gives up the song.\n</eight>\n\n<nine>\nNow, only \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is playing, as the voices rise to a swell. And we come to the heart of the entire scene: Yvonne. The story of Yvonne (Madeleine Lebeau) in Casablanca is perhaps the greatest example of economy in storytelling that I\u2019ve seen. She appears in only three scenes in the entire film, with this one the last of them. Her total screen time combined is probably no more than a minute. And yet, in those brief stretches, we see an entire character arc play out; and what\u2019s more, an arc that acts as a microcosm of the entire film.\n</nine>\n<ten>\nWe first see Yvonne early in the film, as she\u2019s upset and confronting Rick because he\u2019s rebuffed her after the two of them apparently shared a one-night stand. She tries to get drunker, but Rick takes that away from her too and has her sent home. The next time she appears, she\u2019s at the bar and romantically entwined with a German soldier. A Frenchman takes exception to that pairing and starts a fight; Yvonne sides with the German. These two scenes, as brief as they are, tell us so much about her. She\u2019s a broken woman, desperately seeking a man, possibly for love but more likely for a sense of protection and comfort in dangerous times. This desperation leads her all the way to the point of willingly collaborating and romantically pairing with a German.\n</ten>\n<eleven>\nBut then, there\u2019s \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d A sudden and fervent outburst of patriotism that spreads like wildfire through the bar, overwhelming the Germans and awakening a passion in its singers. As the song begins to near its climax, we get a close-up of Yvonne, singing along with a very different kind of passion. We see tears streaking down her face and a pained expression as she sings. In just these few seconds, you can see a mountain of development and emotion. The same woman who was willing to compromise everything for her own security is realizing how far that compromise has made her fall; is realizing that she may never see the homeland she loves again; is realizing that she\u2019d rather die a true Frenchwoman than live a traitor. It\u2019s the same type of journey we see Rick travel more slowly throughout the movie, and shows perhaps the film\u2019s most important motif: the choice between personal desire or safety and the greater good. How many people must have faced similar choices in the war \u2014 to collaborate or die? Yvonne isn\u2019t just herself in this scene; she\u2019s representing scores of people as she faces hard truths and makes her emotional break.\n</eleven>\n<ELEVEN_shot>\nYvonne's emotional moment is captured in what begins as a medium close-up and gradually transitions to a tight close-up through a slow push-in. The camera remains static once it reaches the close-up, letting her performance fill the frame. The shot is held steady for an extended duration, allowing the audience to fully absorb the emotion in her face as tears begin to stream down her cheeks. The lighting is particularly noteworthy here, with a soft key light emphasizing her tears and the anguish in her expression.\n</ELEVEN_shot>\n<twelve>\nWe then move to Ilsa, and without a word, she conveys everything we need to know about her relationship with Victor. The movie wouldn\u2019t be nearly as enduring without Bergman\u2019s flawless portrayal of Ilsa. It\u2019s easy to imagine a version of the film with Ilsa coming across as just a reductive caricature; her role in the plot revolves mostly around her being torn between two men whom she both loves. But Bergman imbues her with such subtle strength that Ilsa always feels like she has agency. Even when she tells Rick near the end that he must make the choices for both of them, it feels like a lie; she believes Rick will choose to keep her and him together, so telling him to make the choice is itself the choice.\n</twelve>\n<thirteen>\nBut while Casablanca gives us flashbacks to Ilsa and Rick\u2019s time together in Paris, the development of Ilsa and Victor is mostly expository. This scene is perhaps the best representation of how they fit together. Victor charged past Ilsa without a word, and we already saw the dread in her face as she knew what he was about to do. Now we get the first shot of her reaction to \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d after it\u2019s begun. You can see it on her face and in the deep breaths she takes: she knows. She knows what this means for Victor, for his cause, for her, for their relationship. His open defiance in the face of the German soldiers will end all good hope they had of ever leaving Casablanca alive and together. You can see her heart breaking as she recognizes their predicament before anyone else in the room has even considered it.\n</thirteen>\n<THIRTEEN_shot>\nThe cinematography during Ilsa's reaction sequence employs a series of increasingly intimate shots. It begins with a medium shot as she first realizes Victor's intentions, then moves to a medium close-up as she processes the implications. The camera work is particularly effective in its use of rack focus - when Victor charges past her, the focus pulls from her to him, then back to her again, creating a visual connection between their reactions. As her emotional journey deepens, the camera moves in to a close-up, held steady to capture every nuance of Bergman's performance. The sequence uses shallow focus throughout, keeping the background intentionally soft to emphasize her emotional isolation in this moment.\n</THIRTEEN_shot>\n<fourteen>\nBut then the camera cuts back to Victor, still singing triumphantly. There is such bravado in Henreid\u2019s performance here; it\u2019s the one scene where you can really see Victor as a revolutionary leader, capable of inspiring people into acts of defiance in the face of tyranny. When the camera reaches Ilsa again, her expression has softened, melted even, into one of love. A bittersweet love, perhaps, but an evident one. She knows that this reckless disregard for his own life is that same thing that once landed Victor in a concentration camp and threatens him again now in Casablanca, but that zeal must be the same reason she fell for him in the first place. Again, the economy of storytelling here is remarkable. Within a handful of seconds, an entire wordless story has been told: Ilsa\u2019s sad resignation to their changing circumstances, Victor\u2019s passionate defiance, and Ilsa\u2019s acceptance of her husband, loving him for the fact that his greatest flaws are also his greatest virtues.\n</fourteen>\n<fifteen>\nIlsa\u2019s acceptance is the final act needed for \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d to move on to reach its climax. Within less than just a couple of minutes, we have had the German aggression, Victor\u2019s rebellion against it, Rick taking his first stand, the overwhelming passion of the French crowd, the redemption of Yvonne painting a story representative of the whole film, and Ilsa and Victor\u2019s unconventional love in the face of adversity. All that remains is the final groundswell.\n</fifteen>\n<FIFTEEN_shot>\nThe cinematographic crescendo of this scene is achieved through increasingly dynamic camera work. It begins with a series of quick cuts between close-ups of various singers, building rhythm through editing. These cuts are interspersed with wider shots that reveal the full scope of the crowd, often using slight upward angles to give the singing crowd a more imposing presence. The camera movement becomes more energetic, with subtle tracking shots moving through the crowd, creating a sense of being swept up in the moment. The sequence culminates in a dramatic crane shot that pulls back to reveal the entire bar united in song, before cutting back to significant close-ups for the final emotional beats.\n</FIFTEEN_shot>\n<sixteen>\nThe power of this scene is helped, of course, by the indisputable fact that \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is an incredible national anthem. While I\u2019m by no means an expert, it\u2019s the best one I\u2019ve ever heard from any country, and its association in my mind with this scene is highly likely to always keep it there. But the scene is also helped by the people in it. The main actors are at their finest here, and I already mentioned how supporting actors gave great little tidbits in the German soldier part.\n</sixteen>\n<seventeen>\nYet perhaps the greatest thing in this scene is that most of the people in it weren\u2019t actors at all; rather, director Michael Curtiz filled the scene with actual French refugees. Keep in mind, this movie came out in 1942 and was filmed at the height of World War II, at a time when Germany looked nearly unbeatable and Nazi occupation of France was indefinite. And here was a group of refugees from that occupation, given the chance to sing their anthem with defiant pride. For one brief moment, this wasn\u2019t a movie. It was real life, and it was tragic, and it was brave. Reports have said that extras were crying on set during filming, and the passion is evident any time you look past the main actors to the background singers. Note, for instance, the furious arm pump by the man in the background behind the blonde woman at the left of the screen:\n</seventeen>\n<eighteen>\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the film is entirely in English; \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is the only foreign language sequence I can recall, and it\u2019s presented without subtitles. (You can find the English translation here; it\u2019s very much a true battle song, in the goriest sense of the phrase.)  For some reason, that adds even more to its power for me. It\u2019s unapologetically French, and derives much of its power from that. It was their anthem, at the time they needed it most. And for the film\u2019s audience, most of whom were probably not speaking French, the intentional creation of a brief language barrier allows for a pure distillation of the passion of the singing; it\u2019s not the words that matter, it\u2019s what they represent to the people saying them. And what they represent is an ability to stand up in their darkest hour and show their oppressors that their pride will never be extinguished.The song ends with one final shot of Yvonne, the final time we see her in the film. With wet cheeks, she yells \u201cVive la France!\u201d\n</eighteen>\n<nineteen>\nI truly believe this remains the greatest scene ever filmed. It\u2019s filled with such raw power and emotion, showing a beacon of light in the midst of some of humanity\u2019s darkest days. It tells so much of a story in such a brief moment, distilling numerous characters down to their cores and giving them developments and arcs through the merest of glances. It\u2019s the turning point that pushes the plot and its characters to the point of no return, where a final and deadly confrontation will become necessary. All because of the power of a single song, and its ability to inspire, to create and destroy, to stoke passions and reconciliations and fears and loves. All because of \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d\n</nineteen>\n",

                "content": "narrative - An adjective describing a film as being primarily a\nwork of fiction, or a noun that loosely means a fictional story.\ndocumentary - Also an adjective or noun category used to\ndescribe a work of nonfiction.\nplot - refers to all aspects of the narrative that we see on screen.\nFor example, in the film Jaws, Chief Brody\u2019s talking to the town\ncouncil on screen would be part of the plot.\nstory - refers to all aspects of the narrative that we do not see on\nscreen; these aspects may include events before, during, or even\nafter the plot of the film. In Jaws, for instance, Chief Brody had\nbeen a police officer in the city prior to the film\u2019s beginning; this\ninformation is part of the story but not part of the plot.\ndiegesis - refers to the narrative that we see on screen. This term is\nmuch more specific to film, however, and refers to the world that\nthe characters inhabit as much as the plot of the film. The\nadjective diegetic, for instance, refers to something the characters\nin the film could perceive, whereas nondiegetic refers to something\nthey could not (see diegetic and nondiegetic sound below).\npoint of view - Most people assume film always has a third-person\nperspective, but even when it does not use a POV shot (see below),\nfilm often has a more subjective perspective through the use of\ncamera placement, voiceover, and other cinema techniques.\nmise-en-sc\u00e8ne - refers to everything in the frame of the film, which\nwould include lighting, set, props, and the staging and movement\nof actors. The term derives from the theater, where it is used in a\nsimilar way. In the 1950s, a group of French critics at the journal\nCahiers du Cin\u00e9ma used this term in a different way. For them,\nmise-en-sc\u00e8ne meant a special aspect of cinema associated with\ncertain directors. Eventually, you will want to understand both\nmeanings of the term, since this secondary meaning is closely\nconnected to the idea of auteurism in cinema.. Initially, however,\nuse mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in the first sense.\nsetting - like the literary term, this word refers to the time and\nplace of the film. The setting for The Usual Suspects, for instance,\nis New York and Los Angeles at a time contemporary with the\nfilm\u2019s year of release (in this case, 1995).\nset - This term refers to the actual construction in which the actors\nare filmed. In The Usual Suspects, for instance, a set might be the\ninterrogation room in the film. Sets are usually built for a film, as\nopposed to shooting on location, where a scene is shot in the actual\nplace in which it occurs in the film. If a film crew shot on location\nin Venice, Italy, for instance, they might actually be shooting the\nscene in gondolas on the canals. Set is also used generally,\nhowever, as a designation for the place where a film is being shot.\n(So even in location shooting, the director would be \u201con the set\u201d of\nhis or her film every time he or she went to the place where the\ncrew was shooting for that day.)\nprop - another term borrowed from theater. A prop is generally \nany object on a set, though clearly the objects that characters will\ntouch become more important. A trumpet, for instance, might be\npart of the backdrop in a music store scene, but if a character is\ngoing to play the trumpet, the prop takes on more importance.\ncostumes - what the characters are wearing. Bear in mind that\neven if a character is wearing contemporary clothing (in some\ncases, the actors\u2019 own clothing), that clothing is still considered a\ncostume.\nlighting - This term refers to the way in which lights are used for a\ngiven film. Lighting, in conjunction with the camera, sets the\nvisual look for a film. The key light is the main light used for a\nscene; back light refers to a secondary source, usually placed\nbehind the actors; and fill refers to a light placed to the side of the\nactors. This system is called three-point lighting and was very\ncommon in classical Hollywood films. You may also run across\nthe term low-key lighting, which means that the film was shot\noften using only the key light at a very low setting. This low level\nof lighting creates dark shadows on the faces of actors and is\nparticularly moody when used with black-and-white film. It is\nmost often associated with film noir but is not exclusive to that\ngenre.\nshot (and close-up v. long shot) - generally, the smallest unit of\nunbroken film. The camera can move within a shot, but the second\nthat the film makes a transition (see below) to another shot, the\nprevious shot has ended. Alternatively, when used with certain\nadjectives, shot also refers to the distance from the camera to the\nsubject, almost always the actor. In a long shot (or a wide shot),\none can see the entire body of the actor; in a medium shot, one\ncan see the actor from the waist up; in a close-up, one can see only\nthe actor\u2019s face (there is no such term as the \u201cshort shot\u201d). You\nmight also see an extreme close-up in a film, where you can only\nsee part of the actor\u2019s face (just the eyes, for example). Also, \nanother common term is the two-shot, which is generally a\nmedium to medium-long shot of two actors; two-shots were very\ncommon in the classical Hollywood era and continue to be used\ntoday.\npan - the movement of a stationary camera on a horizontal axis. A\ncamera on a tripod that moves from left to right (following a\nparade, for instance), would be panning.\ntilt - the movement of a stationary camera on a vertical axis. A\ncamera on a tripod that moves up and down (following a plane\nlanding, for instance), would be performing a tilt.\ntracking shot - the movement of the shot when the camera is no\nlonger stationary. The term refers to the tracks that cameras were\nonce rolled on when creating one of these shots. Although tracks\nare still often used with a tracking shot, the term might also refer\nmore generally to a moving shot that appears stable, such as a\nsteadicam shot, which uses a gyroscope to avoid the shaky effects\nassociated with hand-held shots. You may also run across the term\ndolly shot, which refers to what the camera rests on (a platform\nwith wheels) while the camera moves in certain kinds of shots.\nDolly shot is sometimes used interchangeably with tracking shot,\nsince dollies very often use tracks.\nhandheld shot - refers to a shot where the camera is held by the\ncamera operator. Hand-held shots are often associated with a\ncertain look, which is shaky, and most people associate the handheld shot with a kind of documentary realism. Narrative films and\ntelevision often use the hand-held for this reason, as they are able\nto create a sense of gritty realism. The television show Law and\nOrder, for instance, often uses hand-held shots when the detectives\nare questioning suspects on the streets, giving the viewer the sense\nthat the scene is more real. Bear in mind, however, that no one\ntechnique ever has the same meaning in every film (a handheld \nshot might be used to decrease the sense of realism).\ncrane shot - A shot taken from a crane. You often see these shots\nat the beginning of a scene (using it as an establishing shot) or the\nend of a scene. The end of a movie, in fact, often uses a crane shot\n(though sometimes is even more extreme).\nPOV shot - stands for \u201cPoint of View\u201d shot. This type of shot\ndoes not refer to the technology used so much as the way we\ninterpret it. In this kind of shot, we are looking through the eyes of\na character; you have probably seen a POV shot when a character\nwho has been rendered unconscious is waking (the other characters\nlook directly into the camera, in a low-angle shot (see below), and\nsay \u201cAre you okay?\u201d as the edges of the frame are blurred and the\nspeech has an echo effect).\nhigh-angle shot, low-angle shot - These terms refer to camera\nplacement. If a camera is looking down on an actor from a high\nvantage, it is a high-angle shot; if a camera is placed very low to\nthe ground and looks \u201cup\u201d at actors, it is a low-angle shot. Highangle shots might emphasize that characters are being\noverwhelmed by their circumstances, while low-angle shots might\nemphasize that characters are somehow larger than life. Be very\ncareful, however, when attaching a certain cinema technique to a\nrecurring plot device or tone. There are always exceptions, and\nyou need to evaluate every scene individually.\ntake (and short v. long take) - generally, a take refers to the time a\nshot is begun to the time it stops. On a film set, a director might\nhave to go through several takes before settling on the shot he or\nshe wants (you have probably seen this in films before, with the\nclapboard and someone shouting \u201cTake 12\u201d--meaning they have\ndone this shot eleven times before this one). Alternatively, like\nshot, take also takes on a secondary meaning when combined with\ncertain adjectives (in this case, long and short), except that a long \nor short take refers to time, whereas a long shot or close-up refers\nto distance. A short take, for instance, might be one or two\nseconds long, although contemporary films continue to use shorter\nand shorter takes of less than a single second (making two or three\nseconds, which sounds like a short amount of time, not very short\nat all). A long take would refer to a single unbroken shot that lasts\nfor a larger amount of time--thirty seconds, for instance. One\nextreme recent example of a long take would be Russian Ark, a\nfilm shot on digital video and using a single, very long take for the\nentire film. Another more extreme example would be Alfred\nHitchcock\u2019s Rope, where the director used long takes of several\nminutes apiece and attempted to hide the cuts by tracking behind\ncharacters\u2019 backs or pieces of furniture. Some directors are also\nfamous for the use of long takes, such as Jean Renoir and Orson\nWelles.\nframe \u2013 Literally, a frame of film refers to the smallest unit of film\npossible. Film frames appear on a film strip, which, when\nprojected, creates the illusion of motion. Film is shown at 24\nframes per second (or f.p.s., a common abbreviation). In a much\nlooser sense, scholars sometimes talk about the frame to mean the\nfour sides of the film as it is being projected, and they also often\nuse it as a verb (e.g. \u201cThe film frames the action in such a way that\nwe can see both characters at once.\u201d)\nscreen - often used with on or off to refer to what we see within\nthe frame. On-screen action, for instance, is something we can see,\nwhereas off-screen action might be something we hear but which\ntakes place outside the frame. Screen also refers to the actual\nphysical screen on which we project a film.\nshallow/soft focus - refers to how much of the shot is in focus.\nWith shallow or soft focus, generally we can only see the actor\u2019s\nface in focus. The background appears blurry. This kind of focus\nwas common in Classic Hollywood and is still common, because if \nthe viewer cannot see the background, then the director does not\nneed to light the background, for instance, or make sure the\nbackground is perfectly ordered. Also, a blurry background\nfocuses our attention all the more on what is in focus, which is\ngenerally the actor\u2019s face. Shallow focus is achieved with a long\nlens (this can be confusing, since one would assume a shallow\nfocus would require a short lens).\ndeep focus - refers to a shot in which everything, including the\nbackground, is in focus. This type of shot is much more difficult\nto achieve, since the entire set must be adequately lit, designed,\netc. Also, the danger is that the viewer\u2019s attention will shift from\nsubject to backdrop, but some directors use this \u201cdanger\u201d to their\nadvantage. William Wyler, for instance, in The Best Years of Our\nLives, shows a man playing a piano in the foreground while\nanother man in the background calls his girlfriend (the first man\u2019s\ndaughter) to break things off. Without deep focus, this shot would\nbe impossible. Directors Jean Renoir and Orson Welles are most\noften associated with deep focus, which sometimes (but does not\nalways) accompany long takes and a moving camera (since\neverything is lit, the camera is much more able to move fluidly and\nreposition itself among actors and props).\nrack focus - Shifting the focus from one object to another within a\nsingle shot. Sometimes, directors will use a rack focus when two\ncharacters are on screen at once but are positioned at different\ndistances from the camera.\nediting - refers to the way that individual shots are connected to\none another to make the film.\nmontage - this word has two meanings. First, montage can\nsimply be another word for editing, which is often the way you\nwill see it in film theory or when we study the Soviet filmmakers\nof the early twentieth century. Second, and more commonly in \ncontemporary usage, montage refers to a series of shots edited\ntogether to show a longer activity evolving in a shorter amount of\ntime or to show a series of related activities. A sports film, for\ninstance, might have a training montage, where the character\nbecomes much better at the sport (the film might condense three\nmonths of training, for instance, into a two-minute montage of\njogging, lifting weights, etc.). Or a film might show a series of\nrelated activities through montage. For instance, a film about a\nnews station might have a montage of the evening news preparing\nto air (with shots of make-up being applied to the anchors\u2019 faces,\ncameras being moved into position, producers arguing over a story,\nand other images and sounds we might associate with this scene).\ntransition - refers to the way a shot moves from one to the next.\nFilms use several different kinds of transitions, including:\n\u2022 cut - simply splicing one shot to the next. The most common\nkind of transitions, cuts are used extensively in editing.\n\u2022 dissolve - when one shot \u201cbleeds\u201d into another. In other words,\nthe end of the first shot is still visible as the second shot\nbecomes visible. Dissolves are often (but not always) used to\nshow a smaller amount of time passing than a fade in or fade\nout.\n\u2022 fade in, fade out - Going from black (nothing on the screen) to a\nshot (fade in), or going from a shot to black (fade out). These\ntransitions usually (but not always) connote a larger amount\nof time passing or might also be used to signal a break in the\nnarrative (the end of an act, for instance).\n\u2022 wipe - one shot \u201cwipes\u201d across the screen and replaces another.\nYou do not see wipes used overly often in contemporary\nfilms, although some directors use them often (the Star Wars\nfilms use wipes consistently).\n\u2022 iris-in, iris-out - this transition almost never appears in\ncontemporary films and was used much more commonly in\nearly cinema. Here, the shot goes from a full frame to\nfocusing a small circle around a certain part of the shot, with\neverything else blacked out (the iris-in), or the reverse occurs\n(the iris-out). You may have seen this transition at the end of\na Looney Tunes cartoon, when the cartoon character will\nsometimes poke his or her head out of the iris as it closes in\nand crack one last joke (e.g when Porky Pig says, \u201cTha-thatha, that\u2019s all folks\u201d).\nscene - a series of shots that form a cohesive unit of narrative. For\ninstance, in Rear Window, we might discuss the scene where Grace\nKelly kids Jimmy Stewart about not marrying her yet. Films have\nboth acts and scenes, like theater, although they are often less\nobvious because there are rarely intermissions or accompanying\nprograms in film. Screenwriters typically use acts when writing a\nfilm. Scholars, however, almost never discuss an act of a film,\nwhereas scene is used extensively.\ncontinuity editing - also called invisible editing or Classic\nHollywood editing. This system of editing is the system that\nClassic Hollywood established (though it had been in use before\nthat period) and is essentially the system that exists today.\nUnderstanding this system is crucial to understanding cinema,\nsince even those directors who break with this system are in a\nsense defining themselves against it. This system is associated\nwith the following other terms:\n\u2022 establishing shot - This term has two meanings. In one context,\nestablishing shot refers to the shot at a beginning of a film or\nscene that established location. For instance, if the setting of\na film is 1940s Occupied France, the film might open with a\nshot of the Eiffel Tower with two Gestapo soldiers in the \nforeground. This shot establishes place (and sometimes, as in\nthis example, time). Establishing shot is also used in\ncontinuity editing to describe a shot that establishes the\nspatial relationships in a given scene.\n\u2022 shot/reverse shot - After an establishing shot, the shot-reverse\nshot refers to the close-ups used when two characters are in\nconversation. (Because we have already used an establishing\nshot, we now know where the characters are in relation to\none another.)\n\u2022 match-on-action - connects two shots cut together by having a\ncharacter finish an action in the second shot begun in the first\nshot. For instance, if a character lights a match in the first\nshot, the same character will draw it up to a cigarette in the\nsecond.\n\u2022 eyeline match - The directions that actors look affect the way we\nperceive their spatial relationships to one another. Eyeline\nmatches are important for establishing who a character is\ntalking to or what a character is looking at. For instance, if a\ncharacter is talking to two people on either side of him or her,\nthen the character will look to the left of the camera to\nconnote that he or she is talking to the person in that\ndirection.\n\u2022 the 180-degree rule - This term refers to the rule that once a\nspatial relationship has been confirmed with the establishing\nshot, no close-up will cross the imaginary line drawn\nbetween those two actors until a new line (or axis) has been\nestablished, usually through another establishing shot.\nzoom-in, zoom-out - using certain lenses, the camera can move\nmore closely into a subject (the zoom-in) or pull back (the zoomout). The zoom-in is sometimes called a push-in, and the zoom-\nout is sometimes called the pull-back.\nsound - everything we hear from the audio track of the film.\nmusic - any music that comes from the audio track. Music might\nbe diegetic (a song on the radio of a car a character is driving) or\nnondiegetic (scary music when a villain appears on screen).\ndiegetic sound - sound that other characters would be able to\nhear. A song on a radio, for instance, as a character drives down\nthe highway, would be a diegetic sound, as would someone\ncoughing audibly during a scene. It is important to note that\ndiegetic sound is a sound that characters could hear, even if they\nare not present when that sound occurs. The sound of a radio\nplaying in an apartment, for instance, is a diegetic sound, even if\nno character is present in the apartment during the scene.\nnondiegetic sound - sound that characters cannot hear. The two\nmost common types of nondiegetic sound are voiceovers, which is\na character\u2019s narration that plays over any given scene, and\nnondiegetic music, which is music used to inflect the mood of a\ngiven scene. Creepy horror-movie music, for instance, that plays\nwhen a character is walking into an old house, is nondiegetic\nmusic, since that character cannot hear the music. Sometimes, this\neffect is parodied (with characters commenting on the scary music\nplaying), and some directors will transition from a nondiegetic\nsound to a diegetic sound (or vice-versa), as when a song is\nplaying on a radio that then becomes the nondiegetic music even as\nthe characters move into a new scene without the radio in it.\nambient sound - This term generally refers to any sounds that are\nused to establish location. The ambient sound of a scene in a park,\nfor instance, might include birds chirping, children laughing, or a\ndog barking. The ambient sound of a train station would include\nthe whine of train brakes, the tinny sounds of arrival and departure ",

                "content": "<one>\nThe scene marks a major turning point in the film. Directly preceding this scene, the bar owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart) refuses to give or sell letters of transit to the war hero/revolutionary Victor Laszlo (Paul Heinreid). The letters of transit are the only hope of freedom for Victor, and his only chance at returning to his efforts at insurgency against the Nazis; Rick knows this, but is still too hurt and bitter that his lost love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has chosen Victor over him. Rick\u2019s refusal is essentially a Nazi victory, despite his careful attempts at framing his (in)actions as simple neutrality. The Germans, led by Major Strausser (Conrad Veidt), have established a de facto control over Casablanca, acting through the openly self-interested French Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains).\n</one>\n<two>\nAfter \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d everything changes. The uneasy stalemate between Victor Laszlo and Major Strausser can no longer continue in the face of such open defiance of German power. Strausser orders Renault to find a pretense to shut down Rick\u2019s \u2014 leading to arguably the film\u2019s best exchange of dialogue. Strausser uses Ilsa to increase the pressure on Victor. Everything kicks into gear, as now Rick, Ilsa, Victor, and Louis are all forced into unpleasant decisions that will push the film toward its climax.\n</two>\n<three>\nAnd it all begins with the anthems. As Rick and Victor are ending their disagreement, they hear the German soldiers in the bar below, joyfully and triumphantly singing \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d The rest of the bar is made up largely of refugees from the German war machine, so the anthem feels almost like taunting, a callous display of German power over people seeking to escape their conquering. Even the ever-compliant Louis looks on at the singing with an expression that could be construed as disapproval, before glancing toward Rick to see what he\u2019ll do. (Rick is a constant source of curiosity for Louis throughout the film.) This expression is the first and barest foreshadowing we receive of Louis\u2019s eventual turn.\n</three>\n<four>\nVictor spends only seconds taking in the scene in front of him before marching straight down to the bar\u2019s band. As he passes, the camera zooms in on Ilsa as she watches him go by with a look of only partially contained dread. She knows this man and exactly what he\u2019s about to do.\n</four>\n<five>\nVictor reaches the band and immediately demands that they play \u201cLa Marseillaise,\u201d the French national anthem. Here we see, for the first and perhaps only time, what has made Victor such an important figure. There\u2019s such a fierceness to him, an intensity that comes bursting out as he repeats his demand \u2014 \u201cPlay it\u201d \u2014 less than second after first making it.\n</five>\n<six>\nThe band leader looks first to Rick for approval; the film had already established previously the absolute loyalty that Rick receives from his employees, in a scene where the bartender cuts off a patron on Rick\u2019s orders despite protests for one more drink. Nothing that follows can happen without Rick\u2019s assent. Bogart\u2019s nod is such a small gesture, but carries such enormous weight. This is the first moment of Rick choosing a side, of joining in resistance in some small way.\n</six>\n<seven>\nThe band launches into \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d with Victor leading the singing, and within two seconds, the entire bar (except the Germans) has stood and joined him. Everyone was ready and waiting for this to happen, even if they didn\u2019t know it: the kindling was already there, and Victor was the spark to light it. Major Strausser makes one attempt to rouse his soldiers into louder voices, but it\u2019s no use. The Germans are but one small enclave, finding themselves within a community that\u2019s filled with less traditional power but greater numbers and far superior zeal. Within moments, \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d has drowned out \u201cDie Wacht am Rhein.\u201d\n</seven>\n<eight>\nStrausser is forced to give up and sit down in anger. That moment is also an example of one of the fascinating things about this scene, and why I\u2019ve rewatched it by itself so many times. While the main focus in on just a small handful of characters, there are numerous people around the edges of shots whose actions and expressions add greatly to the emotions being played out. Take, for instance, the German officer to Strausser\u2019s right (screen left), and the frustration and disgust on his face as he finally gives up the song.\n</eight>\n<nine>\nNow, only \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is playing, as the voices rise to a swell. And we come to the heart of the entire scene: Yvonne. The story of Yvonne (Madeleine Lebeau) in Casablanca is perhaps the greatest example of economy in storytelling that I\u2019ve seen. She appears in only three scenes in the entire film, with this one the last of them. Her total screen time combined is probably no more than a minute. And yet, in those brief stretches, we see an entire character arc play out; and what\u2019s more, an arc that acts as a microcosm of the entire film.\n</nine>\n<ten>\nWe first see Yvonne early in the film, as she\u2019s upset and confronting Rick because he\u2019s rebuffed her after the two of them apparently shared a one-night stand. She tries to get drunker, but Rick takes that away from her too and has her sent home. The next time she appears, she\u2019s at the bar and romantically entwined with a German soldier. A Frenchman takes exception to that pairing and starts a fight; Yvonne sides with the German. These two scenes, as brief as they are, tell us so much about her. She\u2019s a broken woman, desperately seeking a man, possibly for love but more likely for a sense of protection and comfort in dangerous times. This desperation leads her all the way to the point of willingly collaborating and romantically pairing with a German.\n</ten>\n<eleven>\nBut then, there\u2019s \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d A sudden and fervent outburst of patriotism that spreads like wildfire through the bar, overwhelming the Germans and awakening a passion in its singers. As the song begins to near its climax, we get a close-up of Yvonne, singing along with a very different kind of passion. We see tears streaking down her face and a pained expression as she sings. In just these few seconds, you can see a mountain of development and emotion. The same woman who was willing to compromise everything for her own security is realizing how far that compromise has made her fall; is realizing that she may never see the homeland she loves again; is realizing that she\u2019d rather die a true Frenchwoman than live a traitor. It\u2019s the same type of journey we see Rick travel more slowly throughout the movie, and shows perhaps the film\u2019s most important motif: the choice between personal desire or safety and the greater good. How many people must have faced similar choices in the war \u2014 to collaborate or die? Yvonne isn\u2019t just herself in this scene; she\u2019s representing scores of people as she faces hard truths and makes her emotional break.\n</eleven>\n<twelve>\nWe then move to Ilsa, and without a word, she conveys everything we need to know about her relationship with Victor. The movie wouldn\u2019t be nearly as enduring without Bergman\u2019s flawless portrayal of Ilsa. It\u2019s easy to imagine a version of the film with Ilsa coming across as just a reductive caricature; her role in the plot revolves mostly around her being torn between two men whom she both loves. But Bergman imbues her with such subtle strength that Ilsa always feels like she has agency. Even when she tells Rick near the end that he must make the choices for both of them, it feels like a lie; she believes Rick will choose to keep her and him together, so telling him to make the choice is itself the choice.\n</twelve>\n<thirteen>\nBut while Casablanca gives us flashbacks to Ilsa and Rick\u2019s time together in Paris, the development of Ilsa and Victor is mostly expository. This scene is perhaps the best representation of how they fit together. Victor charged past Ilsa without a word, and we already saw the dread in her face as she knew what he was about to do. Now we get the first shot of her reaction to \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d after it\u2019s begun. You can see it on her face and in the deep breaths she takes: she knows. She knows what this means for Victor, for his cause, for her, for their relationship. His open defiance in the face of the German soldiers will end all good hope they had of ever leaving Casablanca alive and together. You can see her heart breaking as she recognizes their predicament before anyone else in the room has even considered it.\n</thirteen>\n<fourteen>\nBut then the camera cuts back to Victor, still singing triumphantly. There is such bravado in Henreid\u2019s performance here; it\u2019s the one scene where you can really see Victor as a revolutionary leader, capable of inspiring people into acts of defiance in the face of tyranny. When the camera reaches Ilsa again, her expression has softened, melted even, into one of love. A bittersweet love, perhaps, but an evident one. She knows that this reckless disregard for his own life is that same thing that once landed Victor in a concentration camp and threatens him again now in Casablanca, but that zeal must be the same reason she fell for him in the first place. Again, the economy of storytelling here is remarkable. Within a handful of seconds, an entire wordless story has been told: Ilsa\u2019s sad resignation to their changing circumstances, Victor\u2019s passionate defiance, and Ilsa\u2019s acceptance of her husband, loving him for the fact that his greatest flaws are also his greatest virtues.\n</fourteen>\n<fifteen>\nIlsa\u2019s acceptance is the final act needed for \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d to move on to reach its climax. Within less than just a couple of minutes, we have had the German aggression, Victor\u2019s rebellion against it, Rick taking his first stand, the overwhelming passion of the French crowd, the redemption of Yvonne painting a story representative of the whole film, and Ilsa and Victor\u2019s unconventional love in the face of adversity. All that remains is the final groundswell.\n</fifteen>\n<sixteen>\nThe power of this scene is helped, of course, by the indisputable fact that \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is an incredible national anthem. While I\u2019m by no means an expert, it\u2019s the best one I\u2019ve ever heard from any country, and its association in my mind with this scene is highly likely to always keep it there. But the scene is also helped by the people in it. The main actors are at their finest here, and I already mentioned how supporting actors gave great little tidbits in the German soldier part.\n</sixteen>\n<seventeen>\nYet perhaps the greatest thing in this scene is that most of the people in it weren\u2019t actors at all; rather, director Michael Curtiz filled the scene with actual French refugees. Keep in mind, this movie came out in 1942 and was filmed at the height of World War II, at a time when Germany looked nearly unbeatable and Nazi occupation of France was indefinite. And here was a group of refugees from that occupation, given the chance to sing their anthem with defiant pride. For one brief moment, this wasn\u2019t a movie. It was real life, and it was tragic, and it was brave. Reports have said that extras were crying on set during filming, and the passion is evident any time you look past the main actors to the background singers. Note, for instance, the furious arm pump by the man in the background behind the blonde woman at the left of the screen:\n</seventeen>\n<eighteen>\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the film is entirely in English; \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d is the only foreign language sequence I can recall, and it\u2019s presented without subtitles. (You can find the English translation here; it\u2019s very much a true battle song, in the goriest sense of the phrase.)  For some reason, that adds even more to its power for me. It\u2019s unapologetically French, and derives much of its power from that. It was their anthem, at the time they needed it most. And for the film\u2019s audience, most of whom were probably not speaking French, the intentional creation of a brief language barrier allows for a pure distillation of the passion of the singing; it\u2019s not the words that matter, it\u2019s what they represent to the people saying them. And what they represent is an ability to stand up in their darkest hour and show their oppressors that their pride will never be extinguished.The song ends with one final shot of Yvonne, the final time we see her in the film. With wet cheeks, she yells \u201cVive la France!\u201d\n</eighteen>\n<nineteen>\nI truly believe this remains the greatest scene ever filmed. It\u2019s filled with such raw power and emotion, showing a beacon of light in the midst of some of humanity\u2019s darkest days. It tells so much of a story in such a brief moment, distilling numerous characters down to their cores and giving them developments and arcs through the merest of glances. It\u2019s the turning point that pushes the plot and its characters to the point of no return, where a final and deadly confrontation will become necessary. All because of the power of a single song, and its ability to inspire, to create and destroy, to stoke passions and reconciliations and fears and loves. All because of \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d\n</nineteen>\n",

You will learn about dynamic memory management, pointer manipulation, and pointer casting.\nThe type of allocator you will implement is a pool allocator, using multiple memory pools. Each memory pool consists of allocations of a fixed size. Allocations are served out of the smallest pool that supports the user\u2019s request, and allocations too large for any memory pool are requested from the OS directly. The memory pools in this project will contain allocations ranging from 32 bytes to 4096 bytes.\nYour allocator is designed in such away that You may be able to use it to run standardUnix binaries! Because you will not be implementing support for concurrency, some programs may fail through no fault of your own; however, many programs will operate correctly. You may find it interesting and enjoyable to use your allocator implementation to learn about the memory accesses of standard applications.\nThis document is long, but there is a reason for that. Please read it carefully and in its entirety before starting your assignment! There are many subtle requirements in this document that will require critical thinking about program structure; for example, the relationship between allocation sizes and the free list table. Plan to sit down and draw out your data structures and implementation when you begin. You will not \u201csave time\u201d by skipping this step!\n\n1_Getting_Started\nYou should have received a GitHub Classroom invitation for this assignment. Follow it, then check out your repository.\nChapter 9, Section 9.9 of Computer Systems: A Programmer\u2019s Perspective describes a dynamic allocator implementation in some detail. You may want to read this section before starting your project, and will certainly want to read it carefully while implementing your project. Note, however, that it is not the same allocator that you are required to implement for this project, and that it has some questionable stylistic decisions!\nChapter 8, Section 8.7 of The C Programming Language also describes a dynamic allocator of similar structure to that described in CS:APP. This allocator is described in somewhat less detail, but uses techniques (such as declaring structures to hold metadata, rather than using macros and pointer math) that are to be preferred over the approach in CS:APP, so you should read and try to understand it, as well. Again, you may want to read this section before you begin, and will certainly want to read it carefully during implementation. Note again that it is not the same allocator as required for this project, and that in particular you should not use any union data types in your implementation.\nYou will absolutely need to read man 3 malloc. It is not long. We will not answer questions that are clearly answered in man 3 malloc.\nSome parts of this handout may not make much sense until you have read the above readings.\n\n2_Pool_Allocators\nPool allocators are designed to allow applications to efficiently allocate, free, and reallocate chunks of memory in sizes that are used frequently. This is an effective strategy for many applications because it is common for an application to allocate many objects that are the same size \u2014 for example, nodes in a linked list or tree, or buffers for communication. Placing such frequently-used objects in a pool where they can be rapidly reallocated improves application performance.\nAllocation pools are maintained by requesting large-ish blocks of memory from the operating system, then breaking those blocks up into the allocation size stored in a pool. These \u201cfree\u201d blocks are then used to serve allocations requested by the user. When blocks are freed by the user, they are simply placed back in the pool, preventing future allocations from having to request more memory from the operating system. When an allocation is requested from a pool that does not contain any free blocks, the allocator will request another large chunk from the operating system to be broken up again.\nYou will be implementing a multi-pool allocator, which will maintain pools containing allocation blocks with sizes of powers of two between 25 (32) and 212 (4096). These blocks will be used to serve allocations of 24 (32\u22128) to 4088 (4096 \u2212 8) bytes, using the remaining 8 bytes between these sizes and the power of two to store metadata. Because the free() function does not accept a size argument, this metadata will be used to store the size of the block for use by free(). Each allocation request will be served from the smallest block that will store the allocation; for example, a 1 byte allocation would come out of a 32 byte block, while a 1000 byte allocation would come out of a 1024 byte block.\n\n3_Requirements\nYou must implement the following functions in the file src/mm.c:\n\u2022void *malloc(size_t size)\n\u2022void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)\n\u2022void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)\n\u2022void free(void *ptr)\nYour implementation must satisfy the standard definition of these functions (see man 3 malloc), with the exception that it need not allow for concurrent access from multiple threads, as well as the additional implementation requirements listed here.\nYour implementation must be multi-pool allocator as described in this document. No other type of allocator implementation will receive credit. It must use pool allocation as described here to implement all allocations between 1 and 4088 bytes, and a simple bulk allocator (described below) for allocations larger than 4088 bytes.\n(The discrepancy between 4088 bytes and the even-power-of-two 4096 bytes, mentioned in Section 2, will be further explained later.)\nAll memory returned by your allocation functions (malloc(), calloc(), and realloc()) must be 8 byte aligned. Failure to maintain this requirement will not result in functional failures of your allocator on the x86-64 plat-form (programs using your allocator would continue to work correctly), but may result in degraded performance for programs using your allocator. On other platforms, failure to maintain this requirement could result in program crashes.\nYour implementation must be able to resize an allocation using realloc. Under certain circumstances it should do this without performing any new allocation, and under other circumstances it should do this by allocating a new block and copying the user\u2019s data from the old block to the new. If it is possible to perform the reallocation without allocating a new block and moving data, your implementation must do so. This is always possible for reallocations which reduce the size of an allocation, as realloc()must return the existing block, and the user will simply use less of it. For allocations which increase the size of the allocation, it is possible only if the block originally selected to serve the user\u2019s allocation is also large enough to serve the new allocation. For example, if the user calls malloc(32) to request a 32 byte allocation, your allocator will select a 64 byte block containing 56 usable bytes of memory. If the user later wishes to realloc() this block to 48 bytes, this does not require any allocation or copying, and your allocator must return the same block. This is because while 48 bytes is more than the original 32 bytes requested, it is less than the 56 bytes available in this block.\nIf realloc() cannot resize a block without performing allocation, it must use your allocator to acquire a new block of the appropriate size (which is necessarily larger than the original block, by these rules), copy the user\u2019s data from the old block to the new block, and then free the old block.\nRequests for an allocation of size 0 to any of the allocator functions may either use the pool allocator to create a minimum-size allocation or return NULL, as you prefer. You will probably find that simply returning NULL is easier, but if for some reason your algorithm benefits from the possibility of returning a minimum size allocation, you may do so.\nYour allocator must be capable of returning freed memory to the heap and reusing it to serve future allocations. In particular, if a program repeatedly allocates and frees many small objects with a constant upper bound on the number of objects and total space required, your allocator should eventually settle on a heap size that requires no additional requests to the operating system for more memory.\nYou must test your own project. The tests provided in Auto-grader will be incomplete, and you should not rely upon them to give more than a rough estimate of your final score. There is no requirement to submit your tests for this project.\n\n3.1_Metadata_and_Global_Symbols\nAs described in CS:APP in Section 9.9, a heap allocator must not use any global state of non-constant size that cannot be allocated from the heap itself. Therefore, you should declare only primitive global (or static) variables for your allocator, and you must use the heap for any other data required. Your implementation will add a few constant bytes to each allocation and store the rest of its variably-sized metadata in free blocks, requiring only a constant allocation at initialization time for its remaining storage.\n\n3.1.1_Static_Variables\nAny global variables or functions declared by your implementation in mm.c must include the keyword static. This will ensure that they are not visible to any other translation units, and that your allocator\u2019s function cannot be disrupted by code that may link to it. (See Section 4.6 of K&R for more discussion of static variables, and the lecture The Compiler and Toolchain for a definition of translation units.)\n\n3.1.2_Block_Headers\nThe metadata stored for each block of memory managed by your allocator (allocated or free) should be a 64 bit header word preceding the allocation (or free block), containing the size of the allocation and some flag bits. Note that the minimum possible block size for the pool-allocated blocks is 25, or 32 bytes, and that all pool-allocated blocks have sizes which are powers of two. Recalling the format of integers in memory, this means that the lowest five bits of the integer size of a block, whether it is free or allocated, will always be zero. (This is because the binary representation of 32 is 1000002.) Those bits can therefore be used to store flags, and then masked out when retrieving the size of a block. CS:APP explains this in some detail in Section 9.9.6 (In particular, see Figure 9.35).\nYou should use the lowest-order bit (the \u201cones bit\u201d) to indicate whether a block is free or allocated; a one bit will indicate an allocated block, and a zero bit will indicate a free block. While this is not entirely necessary to complete this project, it makes the implementation of a heap validator (suggested in Section 5) much more effective. Remember to account for this when allocating and freeing bulk-allocated blocks, if necessary. You will probably find that bitwise operations are the best way to maintain the allocated bit and other bits in the size field, rather than using + 1 and - 1 (which has for some reason proven both a popular technique and a popular source of bugs in the past). Think about what this means for bulk allocations, and particular block allocations of odd sizes or exactly 4089 bytes, if you choose to do this.\nThe pointer returned by the allocation functions, and the pointer given to free() or realloc(), is the first byte of memory after the header word. Your implementation will have to use pointer math to find the header word for a block that is passed to free() or realloc(), and perhaps to calculate the address to be returned from malloc() et al.\nThis metadata is the reason that your allocator\u2019s effective allocation sizes are 8 bytes smaller than an even power of two. The block from which an allocation is drawn is a power of two in size, but there are 8 bytes of header used from that block for storing metadata.\n\n3.2_The_sbrk_System_Call\nThe operating system provides two system calls to manipulate the program break between the application\u2019s heap and the unmapped memory region above the heap: brk() and sbrk(). The brk() system call accepts an absolute address and immediately sets the program break to that point, while sbrk() accepts a relative size and adjusts the current program break by that amount. It is difficult to use brk() correctly and safely, so we will use sbrk() for this assignment.\nPassing a positive value to sbrk() causes the system to move the program break the requested number of bytes upward in memory, toward larger addresses. It will then return the old value of the program break, which is a memory address. The newly allocated memory therefore begins at the address returned by sbrk() and continues for the number of bytes requested by the application.\n\n3.3_The_Multi-Pool_Allocator\nYour allocator must use the following pool allocation policy for allocations between 1 and 4088 bytes. All allocations from the pool allocator portion of the heap will be in blocks of size 2y, 5 \u2264 y \u2264 12.\nAll allocations of size 4088 bytes or smaller will be rounded up to the next larger integer size x satisfying the equation x = 2y\u22128, for some y between 5 and 12 (inclusive); that is, 24, 56, 120, . . . , 4088. These allocations will be served out of blocks of memory 8 bytes larger than x, to allow space for your allocator to store metadata about the allocation. This means that the smallest unit of memory your pool allocator will manage is 32 bytes (including metadata), and the largest unit of memory your pool allocator will manage is 4096 bytes (including metadata).\nThe provided function block_index()will return y (which you may find more convenient than x itself for some operations), given x. In other words, it will return the log base 2 of the block size required to serve the requested allocation. You can use this as an index into a table of pools containing free blocks of specific sizes, as discussed in Section 3.5.\nYour allocator will maintain a separate free list for each of the block sizes described above. Every block on the free list for a given size will be of that size, and available for allocation. When your allocator attempts to allocate a block of a given size and there are no blocks on the relevant free list, it will request CHUNK_SIZE (4096) bytes of memory from the OS using the sbrk() system call, break the returned allocation up into blocks of the desired size, and place them on the appropriate free list. By calling sbrk() relatively infrequently and serving allocations out of fixed-size blocks in this fashion, you improve the run-time performance of your allocator at the expense of some memory overhead.\nEach allocation in your multi-pool allocator should first attempt to find an existing free allocation block of the desired size. If such a block exists, your allocator should use it. If it does not, your allocator should request\n4096 bytes of memory from the OS as described above, then retry the allocation.\n\n3.4_The_Bulk_Allocator\nFor all allocations of larger than 4088 bytes, a bulk allocator must be used that maps a single object into the process\u2019s memory space directly, and unmaps it on free. The following provided methods should be used to accomplish this; you will reserve 8 bytes of extra memory for bookkeeping when calling these functions; i.e., if your allocator is serving a request for 4096 bytes of memory, you will request 4104 bytes from the bulk allocator. These extra 8 bytes will be used to provide a header for bulk allocated objects in the same fashion as pool allocated objects, so that they can be freed easily.\n\u2022 void *bulk_alloc(size_t size)\n\u2022 void bulk_free(void *ptr, size_t size)\nThe bulk_alloc() function returns a pointer to a contiguous block of memory of at least size bytes, similar to malloc(). However, unlike malloc(), this allocation cannot be freed with free(). Instead, bulk_free()will free this block when provided with both its address and its size in bytes. You may view the implementations of these functions in the provided file src/bulk.c, although you should not modify them and you do not need to understand them. They use the system calls mmap() and munmap() to request specific modifications to the process\u2019s memory map.\nNote that you must provide the size of the allocation being freed to the bulk allocator. It cannot determine this itself! This is the purpose of the extra 8 bytes of overhead requested by your allocator.\n\n3.5_Free_List_Table\nYou must store the free blocks in your allocator in a set of explicit free lists (as opposed to the implicit free list described in CS:APP). For an explicit free list, the allocation space inside a free block (which is otherwise unused) is used to store pointers to the next and previous free blocks on the list. You can define a structure, similar to the ListNode structure you used for PA2, that includes the free block header, a next pointer, and a previous pointer, and then use pointer type casting to map it to the address of a free block on the heap. You may find that your PA2 code can be used almost directly for this project!\nNote that this project requires only that you are able to insert and remove from the head of a list. You should never walk a list. It is important that malloc() and free() are constant-time operations, and for this reason, their run time should not depend on the length of free lists. You can likely therefore use singly-linked lists for this project. All of the allocation sizes are large enough for doubly-linked lists if you wish to use your PA2 code, however.\nAs explained in CS:APP, Section 9.9, this sort of free list requires no extra space. The pointers that make up the free list use the space inside the free blocks that would otherwise be used by the application when the blocks are allocated. Make sure that you understand this subtle point. It is critical that you do NOT manipulate these pointers on an allocated block!\nBy creating a table of these lists indexed by the log base 2 of the size of objects at each entry, you can use block_index() to very quickly determine whether a free block of a given size is available. The block sizes for this project were carefully chosen to be precise powers of two for this very reason. Figure 1 shows an example depiction of such a table.\nYou must allocate the free list table itself on the heap. To avoid malloc() depending on malloc(), you may wish to allocate it directly from memory acquired with sbrk(); because it will never be freed, this is not a problem, and it does not require a header or any other allocation structure. Note, however, that this is very inefficient if you do not reuse the rest of the memory allocated using sbrk() as blocks that can be allocated by the user. The free list table is about 100 bytes, and you must call sbrk() for CHUNK_SIZE bytes!\n\n4_Guidelines\nThere are many aspects of this project that you may choose to implement in a variety of ways. You have examples of some portions of the project in the form of Section 9.9 of CS:APP and Section 8.7 of K&R. This section contains some guidelines on how you might tackle those aspects, as well as general advice to help you succeed in this project.\n\nfigure_1: Figure_1 is A free list table containing six free blocks of memory. Each block is labeled with its size and free flag. Here is the visualization\n```\n12|4096\n11|2048\n10|1024->1024/f->1024/f\n9 |512\n8 |256->256/f\n7 |128\n6 |64\n5 |32->32/f->32/f->32/f\n4 |unused\n3 |unused\n2 |unused\n1 |unused\n0 |unused\n```\n\n4.1_Structures_and_Types\nComputer Systems: A Programmer\u2019s Perspective presents an allocator implementation that uses preprocessor macros and raw pointer accesses to extract essentially all of the information from allocation blocks. I do not recommend this approach. The approach in The C Programming Language is more appropriate, although it uses a union in a way that I do not think is necessary (for portability reasons that we are not currently concerned with), and stores its fields in a different order than is required in this project.\nConsider declaring a structure that encompasses the header word and linked list pointer(s) for the free list, and using that structure to access the free list. You can probably use some of your PA2 implementation\u2019s code for this purpose. Note that you can use the same structure for both free and allocated blocks, provided that you simply do not access the parts of the structure that are inside the user\u2019s memory in allocated blocks.\nThe reason for this recommendation is multi-fold, but the two most important considerations are:\n\u2022The use of macros to implement program functionality can make debugging very difficult.\n\u2022Limiting usage of void pointers and pointer casting as much as possible will help the compiler flag errors, by allowing type errors to indicate logic errors.\n\n4.2_Macros_and_Functions\nThe previous notwithstanding, you will probably still need or want some macros or functions to perform type casting and certain pointer manipulations reliably and consistently. You absolutely should not have random additions and subtractions of fixed values or sizeof() calculations sprinkled all throughout your code! This makes it very easy to miss a location where you should have made such a calculation, and did not; a macro or function to perform this cast and change is a better solution. In general, prefer functions over macros (because of type checking), but in some places macros may be appropriate.\n\n4.3_Task_Decomposition\nYou may find that it improves the clarity and flow of your code by breaking the various tasks down into smaller functions that may even be used by more than one portion of your implementation. You should absolutely do so! Declare static functions in mm.c to encapsulate such functionality.\nIn particular, the logic for requesting more heap space using sbrk() when necessary and breaking up free blocks to serve smaller allocations will likely be shared between several functions.\nRemember also that some operations can be delegated to other required functions\u2014 in particular, malloc().\n\n4.4_Pointer_Math\nYou will do a lot of pointer math in this project! You may find it easiest to do this math by first casting the pointer to void *, then manipulating it using simple arithmetic and sizeof(). Remember that while arithmetic on void * behaves \u201cnormally\u201d, arithmetic on other types operates in increments of the size of the type. This means, for example, that (void *)0 + 1 is 1, while (int *)0 + 1 is 4. Therefore, you may find it less confusing to simply cast any value to void * before manipulation.\n\n4.5_Frequently_Asked_Questions\n\nHow do I test against Unix commands? \nRead the comments in the Makefile. They tell you how.\nUnix commands are running fine, but my allocator fails on Autograder, why? \nCheck to make sure that you don\u2019t see an error like this when you run your command: ERROR: ld.so: object './libcsemalloc.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored. If you do, make sure you\u2019ve run make, that your library built properly, and that you\u2019re in your project build directory.\nWhy is ls crashing? \nIt\u2019s a problem with your realloc(). We promise that ls works, but for some reason it uses realloc() for basically everything. Read the man page for the allocation functions very carefully, and implement your realloc() completely, and it will run.\nHow do I run gdb with Unix commands? \nThis is pretty difficult to do, because of the way your allocator has to be loaded. A better approach is to run ulimit -c unlimited in your terminal before running the Unix command, and then run gdb against the resulting core file. For example:\n```\nulimit -c unlimited\nLD_PRELOAD=./libcsemalloc.so ls\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\ngdb ls core\n<gdb boilerplate here>\n(gdb) backtrace\n```\nEverything works, I can run many things, but some fancy pants program is crashing. Is Unix broken?\n It probably uses threads. If GUI applications (in particular) are crashing for you, it might be your allocator, but don\u2019t sweat it terribly.\nA program says \u201cMemory exhausted\u201d, what does that mean?\nIt probably means that your malloc(), calloc(), or realloc() returned NULL, so the program thinks that there is no memory left in the computer.\nWhy do I keep getting the message \u201cmunmap failed in bulk_free(); you probably passed invalid arguments\u201d? \nIt means exactly what it says. This usually happens because of one of two things: a) you passed a pointer to the middle of some bulk allocated object (possibly after the header?) to bulk_free(), or b) you passed a multipool-allocated object to bulk_free().\nWhy is my allocator crashing? I can\u2019t find the bug! \nWrite a validator. For real. Right now. It will save you time.\nWhat is the flag for in the block header? \nYour validator. You can complete this project without it, but it can make your validator much more robust. Consider including it and checking it in your validator!\n\n5_Testing\nYou should plan to write a heap validator for your project. This is a function that you can call while debugging to crawl through your heap structure and verify its correctness. You should be able to use your list_validate() from PA2 as part of this process, but will also want to check other things that are allocator-specific. You may wish to use debug macros such as discussed in class when talking about the C preprocessor to include extra information for validation, routinely validate the heap, etc., when a debug symbol is defined. Like drawing your data structures, you will absolutely not save time by skipping this step. You should consider developing it along side, or even before, your allocator implementation!\nYour project will be built into a shared object (library) when you run make in the top-level source directory. You can use this library to run standard Unix system utilities using your allocator, or you can link mm.o and bulk.o against tests that you write. The project Makefile is extensively commented and provides information about how to do both of these things.\nLiberally sprinkling your project with debugging statements and correctness assertions that can be turned on and off with the preprocessor will make your job easier. When printing debugging statements, you will want to use fprintf(stderr, ...) for a variety of reasons; in addition to the previously-mentioned benefits of this approach (such as unbuffered output), this is guaranteed not to allocate memory. When debugging an allocator, that is an important property!\nThe debugger will be indispensable for this project. Plan to use it often to examine pointer values. Re-member that the gdb print command will print the value of any expression, including pointer arithmetic and casting.\nSome example simple programs to test your library against include ls, w, echo, and ps. These and many other Unix commands should run under your allocator once it is complete. You can look at their man pages for more information, and TAs may be able to help you find other commands to test. If your allocator becomes sufficiently robust, large applications such as vim will even run! Note that, because your allocator need not support multiple threads (we haven\u2019t yet talked about how to do this), some applications will not run and it is not your fault. If simple command-line applications fail to run, you should suspect your allocator. If large GUI applications fail to run, it is probably that they are trying to use threads.\nTAs and instructors will expect you to have implemented a heap validator and know how to use it on this project. Bugs that appear to be easily identified by a working validator will meet a response of \u201cwhat does your validator say?\u201d If you need help strengthening your validator, ask!\n\n6_grading\n- 1 point.

The main implementation differences are that my version is simpler and more vulnerable to memory fragmentation. In terms of exposition, my style is a lot more casual.\n\nThis tutorial is going to assume that you know what pointers are, and that you know enough C to know that *ptr dereferences a pointer, ptr->foo means (*ptr).foo, that malloc is used to dynamically allocate space, and that you're familiar with the concept of a linked list. For a basic intro to C, Pointers on C is one of my favorite books. If you want to look at all of this code at once, it's available here.\n\nPreliminaries aside, malloc's function signature is\n\nvoid *malloc(size_t size);\nIt takes as input a number of bytes and returns a pointer to a block of memory of that size.\n\nThere are a number of ways we can implement this.

The OS reserves stack and heap space for processes and sbrk lets us manipulate the heap. sbrk(0) returns a pointer to the current top of the heap. sbrk(foo) increments the heap size by foo and returns a pointer to the previous top of the heap.\n\nDiagram of linux memory layout, courtesy of Gustavo Duarte.\n\nIf we want to implement a really simple malloc, we can do something like\n\n#include <assert.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n\nvoid *malloc(size_t size) {\n  void *p = sbrk(0);\n  void *request = sbrk(size);\n  if (request == (void*) -1) {\n    return NULL; // sbrk failed.\n  } else {\n    assert(p == request); // Not thread safe.\n    return p;\n  }\n}\nWhen a program asks malloc for space, malloc asks sbrk to increment the heap size and returns a pointer to the start of the new region on the heap. This is missing a technicality, that malloc(0) should either return NULL or another pointer that can be passed to free without causing havoc, but it basically works.\n\nBut speaking of free, how does free work? Free's prototype is\n\nvoid free(void *ptr);\nWhen free is passed a pointer that was previously returned from malloc, it's supposed to free the space. But given a pointer to something allocated by our malloc, we have no idea what size block is associated with it. Where do we store that? If we had a working malloc, we could malloc some space and store it there, but we're going to run into trouble if we need to call malloc to reserve space each time we call malloc to reserve space.\n\nA common trick to work around this is to store meta-information about a memory region in some space that we squirrel away just below the pointer that we return. Say the top of the heap is currently at 0x1000 and we ask for 0x400 bytes. Our current malloc will request 0x400 bytes from sbrk and return a pointer to 0x1000. If we instead save, say, 0x10 bytes to store information about the block, our malloc would request 0x410 bytes from sbrk and return a pointer to 0x1010, hiding our 0x10 byte block of meta-information from the code that's calling malloc.\n\nThat lets us free a block, but then what? The heap region we get from the OS has to be contiguous, so we can't return a block of memory in the middle to the OS. Even if we were willing to copy everything above the newly freed region down to fill the hole, so we could return space at the end, there's no way to notify all of the code with pointers to the heap that those pointers need to be adjusted.\n\nInstead, we can mark that the block has been freed without returning it to the OS, so that future calls to malloc can use re-use the block. But to do that we'll need be able to access the meta information for each block. There are a lot of possible solutions to that. We'll arbitrarily choose to use a single linked list for simplicity.\n\nSo, for each block, we'll want to have something like\n\nstruct block_meta {\n  size_t size;\n  struct block_meta *next;\n  int free;\n  int magic; // For debugging only. TODO: remove this in non-debug mode.\n};\n\n#define META_SIZE sizeof(struct block_meta)\nWe need to know the size of the block, whether or not it's free, and what the next block is. There's a magic number here for debugging purposes, but it's not really necessary; we'll set it to arbitrary values, which will let us easily see which code modified the struct last.\n\nWe'll also need a head for our linked list:\n\nvoid *global_base = NULL;\nFor our malloc, we'll want to re-use free space if possible, allocating space when we can't re-use existing space. Given that we have this linked list structure, checking if we have a free block and returning it is straightforward. When we get a request of some size, we iterate through our linked list to see if there's a free block that's large enough.\n\nstruct block_meta *find_free_block(struct block_meta **last, size_t size) {\n  struct block_meta *current = global_base;\n  while (current && !(current->free && current->size >= size)) {\n    *last = current;\n    current = current->next;\n  }\n  return current;\n}\nIf we don't find a free block, we'll have to request space from the OS using sbrk and add our new block to the end of the linked list.\n\nstruct block_meta *request_space(struct block_meta* last, size_t size) {\n  struct block_meta *block;\n  block = sbrk(0);\n  void *request = sbrk(size + META_SIZE);\n  assert((void*)block == request); // Not thread safe.\n  if (request == (void*) -1) {\n    return NULL; // sbrk failed.\n  }\n\n  if (last) { // NULL on first request.\n    last->next = block;\n  }\n  block->size = size;\n  block->next = NULL;\n  block->free = 0;\n  block->magic = 0x12345678;\n  return block;\n}\nAs with our original implementation, we request space using sbrk. But we add a bit of extra space to store our struct, and then set the fields of the struct appropriately.\n\nNow that we have helper functions to check if we have existing free space and to request space, our malloc is simple. If our global base pointer is NULL, we need to request space and set the base pointer to our new block. If it's not NULL, we check to see if we can re-use any existing space. If we can, then we do; if we can't, then we request space and use the new space.\n\nvoid *malloc(size_t size) {\n  struct block_meta *block;\n  // TODO: align size?\n\n  if (size <= 0) {\n    return NULL;\n  }\n\n  if (!global_base) { // First call.\n    block = request_space(NULL, size);\n    if (!block) {\n      return NULL;\n    }\n    global_base = block;\n  } else {\n    struct block_meta *last = global_base;\n    block = find_free_block(&last, size);\n    if (!block) { // Failed to find free block.\n      block = request_space(last, size);\n      if (!block) {\n        return NULL;\n      }\n    } else {      // Found free block\n      // TODO: consider splitting block here.\n      block->free = 0;\n      block->magic = 0x77777777;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return(block+1);\n}\nFor anyone who isn't familiar with C, we return block+1 because we want to return a pointer to the region after block_meta. Since block is a pointer of type struct block_meta, +1 increments the address by one sizeof(struct block_meta).\n\nIf we just wanted a malloc without a free, we could have used our original, much simpler malloc. So let's write free! The main thing free needs to do is set ->free.\n\nBecause we'll need to get the address of our struct in multiple places in our code, let's define this function.\n\nstruct block_meta *get_block_ptr(void *ptr) {\n  return (struct block_meta*)ptr - 1;\n}\nNow that we have that, here's free:\n\nvoid free(void *ptr) {\n  if (!ptr) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // TODO: consider merging blocks once splitting blocks is implemented.\n  struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);\n  assert(block_ptr->free == 0);\n  assert(block_ptr->magic == 0x77777777 || block_ptr->magic == 0x12345678);\n  block_ptr->free = 1;\n  block_ptr->magic = 0x55555555;\n}\nIn addition to setting ->free, it's valid to call free with a NULL ptr, so we need to check for NULL. Since free shouldn't be called on arbitrary addresses or on blocks that are already freed, we can assert that those things never happen.\n\nYou never really need to assert anything, but it often makes debugging a lot easier. In fact, when I wrote this code, I had a bug that would have resulted in silent data corruption if these asserts weren't there. Instead, the code failed at the assert, which make it trivial to debug.",

The implementation must provide four core functions: `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`.\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n### 1. Pool Allocation\n- For allocations between 1-4088 bytes\n- Uses power-of-2 sized blocks from 32 bytes (2^5) to 4096 bytes (2^12)\n- Each block has 8 bytes reserved for metadata header\n- Must serve allocation from smallest suitable block size\n- Pools store same-sized blocks\n\n### 2. Bulk Allocation\n- For allocations > 4088 bytes\n- Uses provided bulk_alloc() and bulk_free() functions\n- Requires 8 extra bytes for metadata header\n\n### 3. Memory Management\n- All allocations must be 8-byte aligned\n- Must use sbrk() in CHUNK_SIZE (4096 byte) increments\n- Must be able to reuse freed memory\n- Must maintain free lists for each block size\n- All variable-sized data structures must be heap-allocated\n\n### 4. Block Structure\n- Each block has 64-bit header containing size and flags\n- Lowest bit used as allocated/free flag (1=allocated, 0=free)\n- Free blocks use allocation space to store next/prev pointers\n- Returned pointer must point after header\n\n### 5. Bitwise Operations\n- Bitwise operations are essential for managing block headers: manipulating size and flag bits (particularly the lowest bit for allocation status), masking out flag bits when retrieving size, and handling power-of-2 calculations. The block_index() function and size calculations heavily rely on bitwise manipulation.\n\n## Major Functional Requirements\n- realloc() must resize in-place when possible\n- calloc() must clear allocated memory\n- free() must handle both pool and bulk allocations\n- Must handle allocation size of 0 appropriately\n\n## Testing Requirements\n- Should be able to run standard Unix binaries\n- Heap validator recommended for debugging\n- Thread safety not required\n\n## Implementation Constraints\n- No global/static variables of non-constant size\n- All functions/variables must be marked static\n- Free list table must be heap-allocated\n- Must use explicit free lists (not implicit)\n- Operations should be constant-time\n",

Given a graph G=(V,E), a clique is a subset S\u2286V such that all \\binom{|S|}{2} edges between the vertices in S exist. As we have done in class, we consider the following decision version of the problem of finding the largest clique in a graph.\nThe problem\nGiven a graph G and a number k, does G contain a clique of size at least k? I.e. does there exists a subset S\u2286V such that |S|=k and there are all possible (k2) edges present among the vertices in S?\n\nSample Input/Output pairs\nFor the sample inputs, let us consider the following graph, which we will call G0: the graph is provided in the attached image:\n* Input: G0,3\n* Output: true (Consider the three blue nodes)\n* Input: G0,4\n* Output: false (Every subset of 4 nodes has at least 2 out of the 6 edges missing)\n\nThere are two parts to the problem:\n* Part (a): Show that the Clique problem is in NP.\n* Part (b): Assume that the Independent set problem on graphs on n vertices and bound k on the independent set (i.e. the problem is, given G and k, does there exist an independent set of size at least k in G?) takes time n\u03a9(k) (for large enough k). Prove that the Clique problem also needs n\u03a9(k) time to solve (for large enough k).\n</question>\n\nThe following is the recitation notes that correspond to the question\n<notes>\nThe problem\nArgue that the Clique problem is in NP.\nWhat do we need to do to show a problem is in NP?\nTo show that a problem X is in NP, you need to show that there is a witness for an input being in X: i.e. if X on input I would output true, then there would be a witness w such that in polynomial time, given I and w, one can indeed verify that X on input I should indeed output true. To be more precise, there exists a polynomial time function V (for \"verifier\") such that for every input I, there exists a polynomial-sized witness w such that V(I,w)=true if and only if X on input I outputs true.\nNote the asymmetry above\nNote the inherent asymmetry in the above condition. In particular:\n* If X on input I outputs true, then you just need one witness w such that V(I,w)=true.\n* If X on input I outputs false, then for all witnesses w\u2032, we have V(I,w)=false.\n\nProof Idea\nRecall for the problem, we are given as input a graph G and an integer k and we need to check if G has a clique of size at least k or not.\nIt turns out that in this case the witness for an input instance I=(G=(V,E),k) is just a subset S\u2286V of size exactly k. We now claim that there exists a polynomial time verifier with this witness. In particular, you need to argue the following:\nExercise\nShow that there exists a polynomial time verifier (i.e. an algorithm) V such that on input G and a subset S (as above), it outputs true if S is a clique in G and false otherwise.\n\nAssuming the above is true, here is the quick argument that we want. Suppose on input (G,k) the Clique problem should output true, then there has to be a subset S\u2217\u2286V with |S\u2217|=k such that S\u2217 is a clique and hence we will have V(G,S\u2217)=true, as desired. On the other hand, if the clique problem should output false for input (G,k), then it has to be the case that for every S\u2286V of size k, S is not a clique. Hence for all such S, we have V(G,S)=false, as desired.\n</notes>\n\nGiven the notes and the question, your task is to provide a proof idea",

                "content": "Programming Assignment 5: Synchronization: Semaphores and producer consumer Queues\nCSE 220: Systems Programming\nIntroduction\nThis assignment will require you to implement a semaphore using mutexes and condition variables, then use your semaphore to implement a producer/consumer queue (FIFO) data structure for passing data between threads. You will use POSIX mutexes, condition variables, and threads in this project.\n1_Getting Started\nThe given code for this project contains two source files that you will have to modify, src/csesem.c and src/pcq.c, as well as two header files, src/csesem.h and src/pcq.h that you should not modify. It also contains the source for five tests (two for the semaphore and three for the producer consumer queue) that will run when you invoke make test. When you finish reading this handout, you should read both header files, the given tests, and the given sources before you begin implementation. You will find a variety of advice and clarifying comments in the given code.\n\n2_Semaphores\nThe first part of this project requires you to implement a semaphore called CSE_Semaphore using the API defined in src/csesem.h. There are extensive comments in this file explaining the API and its usage. Your semaphore will be tested directly, and it will also be used as a tool for implementing the second part of this project.\nYou will find information on semaphores in the lecture slides, and Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) contains a detailed description of semaphores with some examples of how to use them correctly in Chapter 31. You should read Chapters 30 and 31 of OSTEP carefully before starting this project, and refer to it as necessary during your implementation. In particular, you will find the producer consumer problem that is described in detail in Chapter 30 with example code in Figures 30.7 through 30.14 very useful. You may be able to use this code in your implementation with some modifications.\nAn efficient semaphore can be created using a mutex and a condition variable. You should implement the semaphore for this project in precisely that fashion.\nYou MUST NOT use POSIX semaphores in your implementation of CSE_Semaphore. \n2.1_POSIX_Mutexes\nThe Pthread mutex API has some complicated options, but you will not need them for this project. In particular, you do not need to use mutex attributes, and can pass NULL for any pointer to pthread_mutex_attr_t. You should only need the functions pthread_mutex_init() [3], pthread_mutex_lock() [3], pthread_mutex_unlock() [3], and pthread_mutex_destroy() [3].\nNote that POSIX mutexes are declared as type pthread_mutex_t, and then a pointer to the declared variable is passed to the functions that manipulate the mutex. See tests/counting_semaphore.c for an example of a typical mutex initialization and interaction.\n2.2_POSIX_Condition Variables\nThe condition variables provided with Pthreads are likewise more complicated than you will need. You may use NULL for condition variable attributes, as well, and you will not need the timed wait facility. You will use pthread_cond_init() [3], pthread_cond_wait() [3], pthread_cond_signal() [3], and possibly pthread_cond_broadcast() [3].\nLike mutexes, POSIX condition variables are declared as their type (pthread_cond_t) and manipulated as the address of the declared variable. The provided test tests/counting_semaphores.c and tests/synchronous_work.c contains examples of typical interactions with condition variables. In your semaphore implementation, you will need to utilize a condition variable to allow threadswhich are blocking on the semaphore towait without busywaiting, but be awoken when they can safely enter the semaphore.\nA typical use of a condition variable looks like these examples from tests/counting_semaphore.c; the first waits on a condition variable, and the second signals it:\n\n/* Waiting */\npthread_mutex_lock (&lock); \nwhile (!quit) {\npthread_cond_wait (&done , &lock); }\npthread_mutex_unlock (&lock);\n/* Signaling */ \npthread_mutex_lock (&lock); \nquit = 1; \npthread_mutex_unlock (&lock); \npthread_cond_broadcast (&done);\n\nObviously, these two operations would have to be executed in different threads for this code to make sense!\n\n3_producer_consumer_Queues\nThe second part of this project requires you to use the semaphore that you created (and likely other synchronization tools) to implement a producer consumer queue implementing the API found in src/pcq.h. This is a logical construction providing two basic operations:\n\u2022 A producer can add an item to the queue. If there is room on the queue, this itemwill immediately be added, where it will wait to be retrieved by a consumer. If there is no room on the queue, the producer will block until room is available, and then insert its item normally. Each item is added to the tail of the queue.\n\u2022 A consumer can remove an item from the queue. If at least one item is available on the queue, the consumer will immediately remove one item from the head of the queue and return it. If no items are available on the queue, the consumer will block until a producer places an item on the queue.\nNote that, because every producer places items on the tail of the queue and every consumer retrieves from the head, this provides first in first out (FIFO) semantics for items placed on the queue. The first item produced will be the first item consumed, and so on and so forth.\nYour implementation does not need to guarantee any particular ordering between different producers or consumers, but it does need to guarantee that all items placed on the queue by the same producer are placed in the order that theywere inserted, and that all items on the queue are removed in the order they were inserted. This means that you do not have to do anything special when waking threads that are blocked on the semaphore, you can simply allow the Pthreads implementation to wake whichever thread it wakes.\nThe item stored in each slot of your producer consumer queue is a single pointer of type void *. You may use this to store a pointer to any data structure, or to store an integer by casting the integer to and from void * when using the queue.\nThere is an example of producer consumer queues in OSTEP Chapter 30. You will not be able to use the example code from the text directly because it uses global variables (rather than created structures) and because it stores integers.\n3.1_Pointer_typedefs_and_Encapsulation\nThe data structure types in this project use typedef. In particular, the following typedefs appear in the given headers:\ntypedef struct CSE_Semaphore *CSE_Semaphore; typedef struct PCQueue *PCQueue;\nThis allows code that uses these types to be less verbose and more clear in its actual purpose. You may use these typedefs anywhere in your implementation and tests.\nAnother benefit of this construction is that the public interfaces for your semaphore and producer consumer queues speak in terms only of pointers to structures which are not defined in the public interface. This provides encapsulation of your implementation; no code external to csesem.c can manipulate the inner data structures of your semaphore, and no code external to pcq.c can manipulate the inner data structure of your producer consumer queue. This technique is often used in C. You can find more information about this technique and how it is used in this project in the respective headers.\n3.2 Partial Implementation\nIf your CSE_Semaphore implementation is sufficiently incomplete that it prevents your PCQueue from being completed, youmaychoose tousePOSIXsemaphores to implementyourPCQueue, in return foragradingpenalty. You may not use POSIX semaphores to implement CSE_Semaphore! The grading penalty is described below, in Section 7.\t\n4_Coordinated_Destruction_of_Resources\nThe destruction of resources in a multithreaded environment, and particularly the destruction of synchronization mechanisms, is fraught with peril. It is very easy to find yourself with an implementation that inadvertently accesses released resources or freed memory during the process of destroying synchronization tools.\nThink carefully about what resources are accessed when and by which threads, and arrange your code to ensure that all threads that might access a resource are notified that it is going to be destroyed and have been given an opportunity to release it before it is actually destroyed. You may find flags or counters in conjunction with condition variables useful for coordinating destruction of your producer consumer queue, in particular.\n5_Memory_Management\nEach of the two constructions in this project defines a create and destroy function. Your implementation should allocate anymemory that it needs on create, and free it on destroy for a given type. You should not use any global or static global variables in this project. All of the state for any semaphore or queue should be stored in the memory that is allocated on create.\nYou should use the standard dynamic allocator (e.g., malloc() or calloc() and free()) to manage this memory.\n6_Requirements\nYou must complete the APIs for both CSE_Semaphore and PCQueue as provided in the header files in the given code. In particular, you must implement:\n\u2022 CSE_Semaphore csesem_create(int count)\n\u2022 void csesem_wait(CSE_Semaphore sem)\n\u2022 void csesem_post(CSE_Semaphore sem)\n\u2022 void csesem_destroy(CSE_Semaphore sem)\n\u2022 PCQueue pcq_create(int slots)\n\u2022 void pcq_insert(PCQueue pcq, void *data)\n\u2022 void *pcq_retrieve(PCQueue pcq)\n\u2022 void pcq_destroy(PCQueue pcq)\nThe complete specifications for these functions are in their respective header files. As this API does not provide a way to report errors, you are not required to handle resource allocation\nerrors (e.g., failures of memory allocation or Pthreads creation functions) or application errors in accessing your implementation. You may assume that the application uses the API correctly as specified in the header files. In particular, the _create() functions will always run to completion before any other function is called on a CSE_Semaphore or PCQueue object, and no new accesses to the objects will be performed after the _destroy() functions have been invoked. (Note that there may be threads already accessing or blocked on your semaphore or queue when it is destroyed, and that it must handle that correctly!)\n7 Grading\nThis project is worth 5% of your final course grade. The points will be assigned as follows, although the Autograder score will not reflect the handout quiz:\n4\nPoints Description 2 Handout Quiz 7 CSE_Semaphore provides counting semaphore semantics 1.5 CSE_Semaphore destroys cleanly 8 PCQueue provides producer consumer queue semantics 1.5 PCQueue destroys cleanly",

This task is fairly straightforward, as\nyou can see in Figure 31.17 (page 17).\nIn the code above, we use just one lock and one condition variable,\nplus a state variable to track the value of the semaphore. Study the code\nfor yourself until you really understand it. Do it!\nOne subtle difference between our Zemaphore and pure semaphores\nas defined by Dijkstra is that we don\u2019t maintain the invariant that the\nvalue of the semaphore, when negative, reflects the number of waiting\nthreads; indeed, the value will never be lower than zero. This behavior is\neasier to implement and matches the current Linux implementation.\n\ntypedef struct __Zem_t {\nint value;\npthread_cond_t cond;\npthread_mutex_t lock;\n} Zem_t;\n// only one thread can call this\nvoid Zem_init(Zem_t *s, int value) {\ns->value = value;\nCond_init(&s->cond);\nMutex_init(&s->lock);\n}\n\nvoid Zem_wait(Zem_t *s) {\nMutex_lock(&s->lock);\nwhile (s->value <= 0)\nCond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock);\ns->value--;\nMutex_unlock(&s->lock);\n}\n\nvoid Zem_post(Zem_t *s) {\nMutex_lock(&s->lock);\ns->value++;\nCond_signal(&s->cond);\nMutex_unlock(&s->lock);\n}\n\nFigure 31.17: Implementing Zemaphores With Locks And CVs\nCuriously, building condition variables out of semaphores is a much\ntrickier proposition. Some highly experienced concurrent programmers\ntried to do this in the Windows environment, and many different bugs\nensued [B04]. Try it yourself, and see if you can figure out why building\ncondition variables out of semaphores is more challenging of a problem\nthan it might appear.\n31.9 Summary\nSemaphores are a powerful and flexible primitive for writing concurrent programs. Some programmers use them exclusively, shunning locks\nand condition variables, due to their simplicity and utility.\nIn this chapter, we have presented just a few classic problems and solutions. If you are interested in finding out more, there are many other materials you can reference. One great (and free reference) is Allen Downey\u2019s\nbook on concurrency and programming with semaphores [D08]. This\nbook has lots of puzzles you can work on to improve your understand-",

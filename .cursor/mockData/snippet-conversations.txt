Some interesting observations:\n- Some lines are empty (like line marked with just \"3\") indicating nodes with no neighbors\n- The neighbors don't have to be sequential (can jump to large numbers like 10608)\n- Each node can have a variable number of neighbors\n- The graph appears to be undirected since we see reciprocal connections (e.g., if node A lists B as neighbor, B lists A as neighbor)\n\nTo create a shorter test file, you would want to:\n1. Keep the format exactly the same\n2. Use a smaller number of nodes (fewer lines)\n3. Use smaller node IDs (smaller numbers) to keep it readable\n4.
